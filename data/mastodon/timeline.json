I want to record my daily life at different devices. I have an iPad, an android phone and a windows laptop, so I need use them at different situations. But the syncing is a problem.</p><p>I recently found I can use iOS shortcuts to boost and simplify the recording process, and I can combine working copy to achieve the pull and push operation. So I wan to change my phone to iOS.</p><p>Another reason, due to a series of processes, opening, writing, syncing, it will produce some psychological burden. It’s not worth to use it only for making some personal fragmented messages.</p>",
