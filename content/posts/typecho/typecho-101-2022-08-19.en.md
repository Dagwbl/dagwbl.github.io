## Insights  

There are still unfinished tasks from before that need to be completed, and today I can finally purchase the sensor.  

Attempting anything new requires a certain level of capability. Otherwise, you will inevitably encounter many unfamiliar challenges along the way. Most people haven’t faced these issues before, so if you try to solve them but lack the necessary skills, you’ll end up wasting a significant amount of time.  

Therefore, no matter what you’re doing, the most important thing is to complete the task at hand using existing methods first. Only when you have spare time should you explore new approaches. This way, you won’t find yourself running out of time with unfinished work.  

Take **Mermaid**, for example—it’s far from mature at this stage. If problems arise, there’s little documentation available online. Unless you spend a great deal of time digging through the source code, troubleshooting becomes a hassle. Meanwhile, I could accomplish the same task with other software in one-tenth of the time.  

Another topic I’d like to discuss is my thoughts and principles regarding purchasing software and expanding hardware.  

Late one night a few days ago, I stumbled upon a software called **Knowledge Base**. After browsing for a few minutes and trying it out, I found it quite impressive. The developer had adapted it for multiple languages, which, as an independent developer myself, I know requires considerable effort. I concluded that the author likely intended to grow and strengthen this software. So, like an angel investor, I spent 59 yuan to purchase a membership—partly out of fear that the price might increase later.  

It was this thought—**"afraid it might get more expensive later"**—that led me to make a decision that, for my current situation, was incorrect. In reality, I didn’t need this software at all. Building a knowledge base on a smartphone is nearly impossible. Unless you rely on your phone for client communication or writing novels for a living, simply holding a phone in your hand is likely to disrupt your focus.  

Speaking of knowledge bases, the setup I’ve developed using **Obsidian + Git (with different branches)** is more than sufficient for my needs. Combined with **PicGo** for direct integration with OSS (Object Storage Service), it’s a perfect solution for me. I can seamlessly continue my work on my dorm computer after leaving the studio. Syncing between two computers is as simple as pulling and pushing changes. Obsidian even has a mobile app, though it’s quite unfriendly for serious work involving formulas and code. But upon reflection, my phone is only meant for jotting down fleeting ideas—so I don’t forget them the next second. When I need to turn those ideas into action, I can always switch to my PC. Thus, I realized my 59 yuan was wasted, adding another drop to my already strained budget.  

As for hardware, contrary to common belief, you often can’t imagine the uses of certain tools until you own them—especially when you don’t have anything similar on hand. My **graphics tablet** is a perfect example. Now, I use it to draft formulas, make annotations in Photoshop, and save a ton of time on image editing and clipping.  

So, if you come across something you want and don’t have a viable alternative, go ahead and buy it.

Once you have something that can stably meet your needs, there's no need to keep looking at other options. Ultimately, we should always focus on the content itself rather than obsessing over switching between different tools. Only when the existing tools become a constraint should we consider breaking free from them.
