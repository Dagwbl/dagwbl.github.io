How to Break Through the Domestic "Chokepoint" Technology of High-Quality Para-Aramid Fiber to Meet the Demands of High-End Applications?  

The localization of high-performance para-aramid fiber—a critical material for advanced applications—faces significant technical bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges, it is essential to focus on key areas:  

1. **Core Technology Innovation**: Strengthen R&D in polymerization, spinning, and heat treatment processes to achieve stable production of high-strength, high-modulus fibers.  
2. **Equipment and Process Optimization**: Develop precision manufacturing equipment and refine production techniques to enhance consistency and yield.  
3. **Raw Material Independence**: Reduce reliance on imported intermediates by establishing domestic supply chains for key monomers like p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and terephthaloyl chloride (TPC).  
4. **Collaborative Ecosystem**: Foster partnerships between academia, research institutions, and industry to accelerate technology transfer and industrialization.  
5. **Standardization and Certification**: Align with international quality benchmarks to ensure competitiveness in aerospace, bulletproof armor, and other high-end markets.  

By addressing these aspects, China can achieve self-sufficiency in premium para-aramid production, breaking foreign monopolies and securing supply chain resilience for strategic sectors.
