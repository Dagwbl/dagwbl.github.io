## 4月7日

渐渐发觉，在自己能力还没有达到能够直接熟练地用英语表达自己想法的时候。强迫自己只用英语输出会导致输出欲望变低，带有一种畏难情绪，好像自己也不知道该表达一些什么样的想法。

昨日，关注的一个英文公众号照例推送了一篇英文文章。我准备阅读之后睡觉，但我在阅读的过程中发现了一些微小的错误；我转头再看对应的中文翻译，辞藻极其优美，这让我不禁怀疑作者是先写出中文，然后翻译成英文的。于是我留言给作者进行了询问，得到的答案不出所料，这给了很大鼓舞与灵感。

母语绝不是我们的学习外语的绊脚石，它给了我们很大的帮助。从中文翻译为英文的过程，也正是母语帮助我们学习外语的最佳过程。

一会我会先写出中文，然后尝试将其译为英文。我相信有一天这个过程会反过来。

> Our body and our mind are in conflict. The body wants to be still, the mind wants to explore the world.

Pride and prejudice are the most disgusting attitudes in the world. I just want to share my new experience with you. These are some ordinary and common things in my mind. But you thought I wanted to gain some superiority from what I want to share with you.

When I thought about it, I felt the feeling of aversion more than you guessed my intention.

There are many interesting things that attract me. It caused me **to** always spend a lot of time on it. Such as coding, playing with cell phone, playing with game and touching myself.

 What are the common characteristics of these things? I can't find the answer right away, because they don't have almost  any similar characteristics.

But what these things have in common, is that they all have the ability to attract my concentration. 

A logical assumption is that all of these things accompany all kinds of information that **comes in**.

I felt very tired today. Actually, I had already slept for two hours.

## Apr 2

I spent an hour beautifying me blog. Now, it became more beautiful.

## Apr 1

Unconsciously, it's already April. I **feel** that my progress cannot **keep up with** the **pace of aging.**

I want to change my life **now** and explore the possibility of life. **But this** behavior **has put a lot of** pressure on me.

There is one of the most important factors **that hinders** me to learn English **continuously**. It's **the** cell phone. I **have** to learn how to resist this big monster. Cutting its tongue is a very useful method, I thought.
