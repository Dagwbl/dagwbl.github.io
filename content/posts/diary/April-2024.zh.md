## 4月12日

今天中午从成都返回贵阳。在蛋糕店准备花了18元买一盒苏打饼干。店员说充值72就可以免费送一盒苏打饼干。再三犹豫，我还是充值了。只希望这个店后面不要倒闭了。

今天傍晚还邀请骚坤和小霞来这里烤东西吃。不过我早早的就把他们撵走了，因为我这里没啥玩的。

今天是来成都培训的第二天，我师傅把我的电脑拿过去打游戏了。我也没有很强的动力学习，所以今天算是浪费了。

不过我非常想买一块平板，我的手机用来刷题我觉得能够显示的信息太少了，而且还很容易被其他App吸引，不能够很专注的学习。

不过看了好久，发现新出的平板都好贵。本来，今晚红米会发布一款名为Redmi Pad Pro 的平板，但是价格高，性能差，很是失望。

于是，我转头买小新 Pad Pro 2023。后面我又给退了，因为我想这是9个月前的平板，且价格还是这么贵。

由衷地感叹现在数码设备制造商不思进取，有时候一些新厂家的新产品还是比较良心的。不过屠龙者终成恶龙这个规律还是亘古不变。

今天一整天都在成都培训，集团的领导还是很想把类似于环保这些事情做好的。但是不知怎么到下面就歪了。

昨晚，姚述屿来到贵阳，然后去到骚坤家喝酒。不出意外的喝醉了，因为今天中午要和同事一起去出差，所以今天起得比平时晚一些也没事。

我从《Perfect Englsih Grammar》这本书中学习到很多有用的建议，很诚恳真挚。

> **It's easy to lose sight of what is important.** You focus on word count rather than results. You lose track of your good idea because you're worried about margings and type size. You're concerned about the introduction but haven't given a thought to the conclusion. You are so worried about your deadline it distracts you from doing the work. Many writers go through this! You are not alone. To focus on what is important, look at the finshed, published writing around you and think, "If they did it, so can I".

> **Format at the end.** Things like bolding, italicizing, and setting margins can be distracions from what matters most. You'll end up having to redo a lot of the foormatting, anyway.

渐渐发觉，在自己能力还没有达到能够直接熟练地用英语表达自己想法的时候。强迫自己只用英语输出会导致输出欲望变低，带有一种畏难情绪，好像自己也不知道该表达一些什么样的想法。

昨日，关注的一个英文公众号照例推送了一篇英文文章。我准备阅读之后睡觉，但我在阅读的过程中发现了一些微小的错误；我转头再看对应的中文翻译，辞藻极其优美，这让我不禁怀疑作者是先写出中文，然后翻译成英文的。于是我留言给作者进行了询问，得到的答案不出所料，这给了很大鼓舞与灵感。

母语绝不是我们的学习外语的绊脚石，它给了我们很大的帮助。从中文翻译为英文的过程，也正是母语帮助我们学习外语的最佳过程。

一会我会先写出中文，然后尝试将其译为英文。我相信有一天这个过程会反过来。

Over time, my speech ability has been getting constantly progress.

> Our body and our mind are in conflict. The body wants to be still, the mind wants to explore the world.

Pride and prejudice are the most disgusting attitudes in the world. I just want to share my new experience with you. These are some ordinary and common things in my mind. But you thought I wanted to gain some superiority from what I want to share with you.

When I thought about it, I felt the feeling of aversion more than you guessed my intention.

There are many interesting things that attract me. It caused me **to** always spend a lot of time on it. Such as coding, playing with cell phone, playing with game and touching myself.

 What are the common characteristics of these things? I can't find the answer right away, because they don't have almost  any similar characteristics.

But what these things have in common, is that they all have the ability to attract my concentration. 

A logical assumption is that all of these things accompany all kinds of information that **comes in**.

I felt very tired today. Actually, I had already slept for two hours.

## Apr 2

I spent an hour beautifying me blog. Now, it became more beautiful.

## Apr 1

Unconsciously, it's already April. I **feel** that my progress cannot **keep up with** the **pace of aging.**

I want to change my life **now** and explore the possibility of life. **But this** behavior **has put a lot of** pressure on me.

There is one of the most important factors **that hinders** me to learn English **continuously**. It's **the** cell phone. I **have** to learn how to resist this big monster. Cutting its tongue is a very useful method, I thought.
