## Apr 4

There are many interesting things that attract me. It caused me **to** always spend a lot of time on it. Such as coding, playing with cell phone, playing with game and touching myself.

 What are the common characteristics of these things? I can't find the answer right away, because they don't have almost  any similar characteristics.

But what these things have in common, is that they all have the ability to attract my concentration. 

A logical assumption is that all of these things accompany all kinds of information that **comes in**.



## Apr 3

I felt very tired today. Actually, I had already slept for two hours.

## Apr 2

I spent an hour beautifying me blog. Now, it became more beautiful.

## Apr 1

Unconsciously, it's already April. I **feel** that my progress cannot **keep up with** the **pace of aging.**

I want to change my life **now** and explore the possibility of life. **But this** behavior **has put a lot of** pressure on me.

There is one of the most important factors **that hinders** me to learn English **continuously**. It's **the** cell phone. I **have** to learn how to resist this big monster. Cutting its tongue is a very useful method, I thought.
