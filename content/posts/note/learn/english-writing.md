## Perfect English Grammar

It’s easy to lose sight of what is important. You focus on word count
rather than results. You lose track of your good idea because you’re
worried about margins or type size. You’re concerned about the
introduction but haven’t given a thought to the conclusion. You’re so
worried about your deadline it distracts you from doing the work. Many
writers go through this! You are not alone. To focus on what is important,
look at the finished, published writing around you and think, “If they did
it, so can I.”
