## Administrative Aptitude Test

### Guizhou 2023, March 13, 2025

Score: $\frac {110-29}{110}\times {100}=73.63$

This set of questions felt manageable, but I ran out of time. Lessons from the mistakes:

1. If multiple options seem correct, the majority are usually right;
2. Helicobacter pylori leads to decreased acidity and chronic gastritis;
3. **Public opinion can melt metal**—a saying from "Strategies of the Warring States: Wei Strategy I." Originally describing the power of public opinion, it now refers to the confusion caused by many voices;
4. **Vulgar customs** refer to societal habits, often with a negative connotation;
5. When setting up equations, use as few variables as possible, choosing the most basic ones;
6. Pay attention to whether the question asks for an affirmative or negative answer;
7. When asked to refute high-salt diets, focus on the harms of high salt; don't choose the benefits of low salt, as they are not directly relevant;
8. In data analysis, always check the time, subject, and what is being asked; read every word carefully, **preferably aloud**.

### Guizhou 2022 "Administrative Aptitude Test," March 13, 2025

Score: $\frac {115-47}{115}\times {100}=58.26$

This set was a disaster.

1. Be cautious with words like <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">inside/outside, up/down, high/low</mark>, as they can be traps;
2. **White Dew** is the solar term with the largest day-night temperature difference;
3. For questions asking how many statements are correct, uncertain ones are usually correct, and often all are correct;
4. **Review all options for non-calculation questions;**
5. In verbal comprehension, always grasp the meaning after a转折 (transition) word;
6. Distinguish between contradictory and opposing relationships. Motion and stillness, right and wrong, cannot coexist—only 0 and 1. Other relationships like size, quantity, and weight have other values;
7. *Many people with hearing loss prefer to use headphones continuously and set the volume above 80 decibels.* Is it because they can't hear that they need to turn up the volume?

### Guizhou 2021 Provincial Exam "Administrative Aptitude Test," March 12, 2025

Score: $\frac {115-33}{115}\times {100}=71.30$

A significant improvement from the morning, but still unstable, especially in common sense questions. The error rate was 2/3. I still haven't found the trick.
Analysis:

1. Unfamiliar with [solar terms](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E8%8A%82%E6%B0%94/453238), need to study them as they are frequently tested;
2. Spiders are not insects; they belong to the class Arachnida;
3. In text structure, if a problem is raised, a solution must follow;
4. [Arithmetic sequence summation formula](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%AD%89%E5%B7%AE%E6%95%B0%E5%88%97%E6%B1%82%E5%92%8C%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F/7527418);
5. Don't panic in calculation questions; find the correct relationships and set up the equations.

### Guizhou 2017 Provincial Exam "Administrative Aptitude Test," March 12, 2025

Score: $\frac {120-52}{120}\times {100}=56.67$

1. In verbal comprehension, focus on key words and转折 (transition) words like <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">but</mark>;
2. Be cautious with options not mentioned; don't over-interpret. For example, cultural refinement does not equate to the ability to appreciate art;
3. In <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">breaking down the whole into parts</mark>, "parts" refers to scattered elements, not nothing;
4. *Work is part of life, but not indispensable;*
5. To refute a point, first understand the point being refuted;
6. Terms like增幅 (increase) and变幅 (change) refer to growth rates;
7. In quantitative relationships, pay attention to the time frame;
8. Carefully check details like output, origin, yield per mu, sales, time, etc. Don't panic.

### [Guizhou 2008 Civil Service Exam "Administrative Aptitude Test"](https://www.gkzenti.cn/paper/1471935720659)

Membership is required to check answers, so I skipped it.

### Guizhou 2009 Civil Service Exam "Administrative Aptitude Test"

Correct answers: 69
Percentage score: 49.2%
The questions were simple, but many mistakes were due to carelessness and not fully reading the questions. More practice is needed. Scoring only half on such simple questions is unacceptable for the actual exam.

### Guizhou 2010 Civil Service Exam "Administrative Aptitude Test"

Score:
$\frac {125-39}{125}\times {150}=103.2$
Percentage score: 68.8%

Analysis:

1. Many quantitative relationship questions were not carefully thought through; equations that could be expanded were not, and angle calculations for clock hands were not precise;
2. In verbal comprehension, I didn't think from the examiner's perspective or as a civil servant, leading to biased understanding;
3. Failed to grasp key points and keywords in verbal comprehension;
4. Insufficient practice in graphical reasoning; chaotic graphs require counting points, lines, surfaces, and colors; also consider parallel lines, right angles, and straight/curved line differences. Remember: **Chaotic elements test counting!**
5. Didn't understand concepts like山峰 (mountain peaks), color harmony, and police violence;
6. Misunderstood concepts like anxiety and emergency incidents;
7. Many questions were not fully reviewed; I jumped to conclusions upon seeing what seemed correct;
8. Quantitative relationships were not calculated; relying on intuition led to errors. Rough estimates are unreliable.

### Guizhou 2018 Civil Service "Administrative Aptitude Test"

Accuracy: $\frac {115-43} {115} =62.6$ points

Mistake analysis:

1. Too many errors in verbal comprehension; need improvement;
2. Data analysis calculations were not careful; must calculate, not guess;
3. Not bad overall, considering the many distractions;
4. **Increase** and **increase to** are distinct; check if the base needs to be added;
5. In verbal comprehension, focus on the topic sentence's keywords to get most questions right;
6. For graphical questions, try to verify by sketching, especially for visual questions;
7. Chaotic elements test counting! (No. 69);
8. Circle the subject in conclusions to prevent concept substitution;
9. Pay attention to否定 (negative) words like **not belonging** or **not**;
10. Mark difficult questions, skip them first, and allocate sufficient time later to avoid losing points.

### Guizhou 2019 Civil Service "Administrative Aptitude Test"

Accuracy: $\frac {115-42} {115} =62.61$ points

Poor performance, especially in common sense questions, with an accuracy rate of only $\frac {2}{15}=13.3\%$.

1. Running performance is better with shorter times, unlike long jump or high jump;
2. Some quantitative relationship questions are difficult; learn to prioritize and let go;
3. In analogical reasoning, prioritize options of the same category;

### Guizhou 2020 Civil Service "Administrative Aptitude Test"

Accuracy: $\frac {115-33} {115} =71.30$ points

A significant improvement from the last attempt, scoring above 70, which is promising for interviews. Mistakes were mainly in common sense and one data analysis question. Data analysis needs further study; some quantitative relationship questions were challenging and require redoing. Analysis:

1. A, B, and C bought 100 yuan worth of goods at the supermarket...
2. Pythagorean theorem, triangle side length ratio calculations, usually without tricky angles;
3. Think rationally, solve step by step; geometry questions are generally simple;
4. In data analysis, first check the time, subject, and other basic information;

### Common Sense Judgment—Guessing Strategies

Civil service exams have a strong political background. Familiarity with this background provides direction, even if the questions are unfamiliar.

1. Questions involving the nation, the Party, or the people are always people-centric, aiming for a better future, and reflecting national pride;

2. The twin options are prone to setting traps;
