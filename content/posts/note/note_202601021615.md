# Part I: Writing a Paragraph

## 1 Paragraph Structure

A paragraph is a group of related sentences that discuss one main idea.

> **Gold**, a precious metal, is prized for **two important characteristics**. First of all, gold has a lustrous beauty that is resistant to corrosion. Therefore, it is suitable for jewelry, coins and ornamental purposes. Gold never needs to be polished and will remain beautiful forever. For example, a Macedonian coin remains as untarnished today as the day it was made 25 centuries ago. Another important characteristic of gold is its usefulness to industry and science. For many years, it has been used in hundreds of industrial applications, such as photography and dentistry. The most recent use of gold is in astronauts’ suits. Astronauts wear gold-plated heat shields for protection when they go outside spaceships in space. In conclusion, gold is treasured not only for its beauty but also for its utility.

### Topic Sentence (Topic + Controlling Idea)

1. A topic sentence contains both a topic and a controlling idea. It names the topic and then limits the topic to a specific area to be discussed in the space of a single paragraph.
2. A topic sentence is a complete sentence; that is, it contains at least one subject and one verb.
3. A topic sentence is the most general statement in the paragraph because it gives only the main idea. It does not give any specific details.
4. Sometimes a topic sentence comes at the end.

### Supporting Sentences

A supporting sentence explains or proves the topic sentence. There are several kinds of specific supporting details: **_examples, statistics, facts, and quotations._**

### Concluding Sentence

1. It signals the end of the paragraph.
2. It leaves the reader with the most important ideas to remember. It can do this in two ways:
    - By summarizing the main points of the paragraph
    - By repeating the topic sentence in different words
3. _Never_ introduce a new idea in the concluding sentence.

## 2 Unity and coherence

### Unity

An important element of a good paragraph is unity. Unity means that a paragraph discusses one and only **one main idea** from beginning to end. Sometimes it is possible to discuss more than one aspect of the same idea in one paragraph if they are closely related to each other.

The second part of unity is that **every supporting sentence must directly explain** or prove the main idea.

### Coherence

Another important element of a good paragraph is coherence. Each sentence should flow smoothly into the next one. There are four ways to achieve coherence:

1. Repeat key nouns
2. Use consistent pronouns
3. Use transition signals to link ideas
4. Arrange your ideas in logical order (chronological order, logical division of ideas, and comparison/contrast

## 3 Supporting details: facts, quotations, and statistics

Don’t just drop a quotation or a statistic into your paper. Make the connection between the borrowed information and your idea clear.

### Facts versus Opinions

First, it is important to distinguish between facts and opinions. Opinions are subjective statements based on a person’s beliefs or attitudes. If you express an opinion, you must support it with facts. Facts are objective statements of truths.

### Use outside sources

There are three ways to insert outside information into your own writing:

1. You can quote it
2. You can summarize it
3. You can paraphrase it

### Quotations

There are two kinds of quotations:

1. Direct quotation
2. Indirect quotation

In a direct quotation, you copy another person’s exact words (spoken or written) and enclose them in quotation marks.

In an indirect quotation, you report the person’s words without quotation marks, but with a reporting expression such as _according to ..._ or _… believes that …_

### Statistics

![](../../../static/images/world%20population%20growth,1750-2150.png)

> According to statistics from the World Population Reference Bureau, the world’s population is increasing at a geometric rate. World’s population first reached 1 billion back in 1804. It took 123 years for it to reach 2 billion in 1927. By 1960, a period of just 32 years, it had added another billion. Just 15 years later, we were at 4 billion, 12 years later at 5 billion, and 11 years after that at 6 billion. The United Nations has projected an increase to 9 billion by the year 2050. Most of the increase will be in the world’s less developed countries (“World“ 1)[^2]

# Part II: Writing an Essay

## 4 From Paragraph to Essay

An essay is a piece of writing several paragraphs long. The principles of organization are the same for both, so if you can write a good paragraph, you can write a good essay. An essay has three main parts:

- An introduction (introductory paragraph)
- A body (at least one, but usually two or more paragraphs
- A conclusion (concluding paragraph)

An essay has unity and coherence, just as a paragraph does. Transition signals and the repetition of key nouns link the paragraphs into a cohesive whole.

### The introductory paragraph

An introductory paragraph has two parts, general statements and the thesis statement.

General statements

- introduce the general topic of essay
- capture the reader’s interest

The thesis statement

- states the specific topic
- may list subtopics or subdivisions of the main topic or subtopics
    1. Young people in my culture have less freedom than young people in the United States in three areas**: Here they live, whom they marry, and what their job is**.    
    2. The Father of Psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, believed that the human mind had three separate parts**:** the id, the ego, and the superego.    
    3. Inflation has **three** causes.
        
    4. Puppies, like children, need **both** love **and** discipline to become responsible members of society.
        
- may indicate the pattern of organization of the essay
- is normally the last sentence in the introductory paragraph
A thesis is the most important sentence in your essay, so write it with special thought and care. Avoid these common problems: too general, too simple, too obvious.

### Body Paragraphs

The body paragraphs in an essay are like the supporting sentences in a paragraph. They are the place to develop your topic and prove your points.

A basic pattern for essays is **logical division of ideas**. In this pattern, you divide your topic into subtopics and then discuss each subtopic in a separate paragraph. Logical division is an appropriate pattern for explaining causes, reasons, types, kinds, qualities, methods, advantages, and disadvantages, as these typical college exam questions ask you to do.

Here are **three keys** to organizing a logical division essay.

1. Divide your topic into subtopics, and then discuss each subtopic in a separate paragraph.
2. Write a thesis statement that indicates logical division.
3. Use transitions between paragraphs to guide your reader from one subtopic to the next.

### The Concluding paragraph

The conclusion is the final paragraph in an essay. It has three purposes.

1. It signals the end of the essay. To do so, begin your conclusion with a transition signal。
2. It reminds your reader of your main points, which you can do in one of two ways: You can
    1. summarize your subtopics
    2. paraphrase your thesis 
3. It leaves your reader with your final thoughts on the topic. This is your opportunity to convey a strong, effective message that your reader will remember.

Here are four techniques that you can use to write a memorable conclusion:

1. Make a prediction
2. Suggest results or consequences
3. Suggest a solution, make a recommendation, or call for action
4. Quote an authority on the topic

### Essay Outlining

An outline not only organizes your thoughts, but it also keeps you on track once you begin to write.

## 5 Chronological Order: Process Essays

Chronological order is a way of organizing ideas in an order of their occurrence in time.

1. Signal words and phrases
    1. first, first of all, second, third, etc.
    2. then, next, after that, soon, later, later on
    3. finally, last, last of all
    4. meanwhile, at the same time, now
    5. gradually, eventually
2. Subordinators
    1. after, since, as, until, as soon as, when, before, while
3. Others
    1. the first step
    2. on the third day
    3. after that morning
    4. for five minutes
    5. in 2004
    6. several years ago
    7. a few weeks later
    8. in the next 15 (past, last) years

# Part III: Sentence Structure

## 10 Types of Sentences

Clauses are the building blocks of sentences. A clause is a group of words that contains (at least) a subject and a verb. There are two kinds of clauses:
- independent
- dependent
An independent clause contains a subject and a verb and  expresses a complete thought.
A dependent clause begins with a subordinator such as when, while, if, that, or who. A dependent clause does not express a complete thought, so it is not a sentence by itself.
### Simple sentences
A simple sentence is an independent clause.
1. Freshwater boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.
2. Freshwater boils at 100 degrees and freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
3. Freshwater and salt water do not boil and do not freeze at the same time
Notice that the second sentence has two verbs, *boils* and freezes. This is called a compound verb. The third sentence has both a compound subject and a compound verb. All three examples are simple sentences because they have only one clause.
### Compound Sentences
A compound sentence is two or more independent clauses joined together. There are three ways to join the clauses:
1. With a coordinator
    Salt water boils at a higher temperature than freshwater, so food cooks faster in salt water.
2. With a conjunctive adverb
   Salt water boils at a higher temperature than freshwater; therefore, food cooks faster in salt water.
3. With a semicolon
   Salt water boils at a higher temperature than freshwater; food cooks faster in salt water.


> [!NOTE] A compound sentence can be formed as follows:
> Independent clause, + coordinator + independent clause

There are seven coordinators: FAN BOYS

| Name | Description                                     | Example                                                                                                                    |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| for  | to add a reason                                 | Japanese people live longer than most other nationalities, for they eat healthful diet.                                    |
| and  | to add a similar, equal idea                    | They eat a lot of fish and vegetables, and they eat lightly.                                                               |
| nor  | to add a negative equal idea                    | They do not eat a lot red meat, nor do they eat many dairy products.                                                       |
| but  | to add an opposite idea                         | Diet is one factor in how long people live, but it is not the only factor                                                  |
| or   | to add an alternative possibility               | However, people should limit the amount of animal fat in their diets, or they risk getting heart disease.                  |
| yet  | to add an unexpected or surprising continuation | Cigarette smoking is a factor in longevity, yet Japanese and other long-lived Asians have a very high rate of tobacco use. |
| so   | to add an expected result                       | Doctors say that stress is another longevity factor, so try to avoid stress if you wish to live a longer life.             |

**Nor** means 'and not.' It joins two negative independent clauses. Notice that question word order is used after nor.

But and yet have similar meanings: they both signal that an opposite idea is coming. But is preferred when the two clauses are direct opposites. When the second clause is an unexpected or surprising continuation because of information given in the first clause, yet is preferred. (But is acceptable for both meanings; yet for only one meaning.) Compare:
- I want to study art, but my parents want me to study engineering.
- I am very bad at math, yet my parents want me to study engineering.

> [!NOTE] Compound Sentences with Conjunctive Adverbs
> **Independent clause; + conjunctive adverb, + independent clause.**
> - Salt water boils at a higher temperature than freshwater; therefore, food cooks faster in salt water.

Punctuation note: put a semicolon before and a comma after the conjunctive adverb.

| for example<br>for instance | Most colleges now have a writing requirement for graduation; for example/for instance, students at my college must pass a writing test before they register for their final semester. |



> [!NOTE] Compound sentences with semicolons
> A third way to form a compound sentence is to connect the two independent clauses with a semicolon alone:
> - **Poland was the first Eastern European country to turn away from communism; others soon followed.**

This kind of compound sentence is possible only when the two independent clauses are closely related in meaning. If they are not closely related, they should be written as two simple sentences, each ending with a period.

### Complex Sentences 
A complex sentence contains one independent clause and one (or more) dependent clause(s). In a complex sentence , one idea is generally more important than the other. We place the more important idea in the independent clause and the less important idea in the dependent clause. There are three kinds of dependent clauses: adverb, adjective, and noun.

#### Complex Sentences with Adverb Clauses 

An **adverb clause** acts like an adverb; it tells **where, when, why, and how**.  
It begins with a subordinator, such as *when, while, because, although, if, so,* or *that*.  
It can come **before or after** an independent clause.
- *Although women in the United States could own property, they could not vote until 1920.*  
- *A citizen can vote in the United States when he or she is 18 years old.*  
#### Complex Sentences with Adjective Clauses 

An **adjective clause** acts like an adjective; it describes a **noun or pronoun**.  
It begins with a relative pronoun (*who, whom, which, whose, that*) or a relative adverb (*where, when*).  
It **follows** the noun or pronoun it describes.
- *Men who are not married are called bachelors.*  
- *Last year we vacationed in Cozumel, which features excellent scuba diving.*  
#### Complex Sentences with Noun Clauses 
A **noun clause** begins with a *wh-* question word, *that, whether,* or sometimes *if*.  
It acts like a **noun** and can be the **subject or object** of the independent clause.

> *That there is a hole in the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere is well known.*  

*That there is a hole in the ozone layer of Earth's atmosphere* is the **subject** of the verb *is*.

> *Scientists know what caused it.*  

In the second example, *What caused it* is the **object** of the verb *know*.

### Compound-complex sentence has at least three clauses, at lease two of which are independent. 
There are some examples:
1. I wanted to travel after I graduated from college; however, I had to go to work immediately.
2. After I graduated from college, I wanted to travel, but I had to go to work immediately.
3. I wanted to travel after I graduated from college, but I had to go to work immediately because I had to support my family.
4. I could not decide where I should work or what I should do, so at first I did nothing.

### Problems with Style  

**Rosa Parks**  

> **1** Rosa Parks is a famous African-American woman, **and** she is often called "the mother of the civil rights movement." She was born into a poor but hardworking African-American family in Alabama, **and** no one suspected that she would become the spark that ignited the civil rights movement in the United States. This movement changed U.S. society forever, **and** it helped African-Americans attain equal rights under the law.
> 
> **2** Parks became famous quite by accident. One day in 1955, she was on her way home from her job in a Montgomery, Alabama, department store. She boarded a city bus with three other African-Americans. They sat in the fifth row. The fifth row was the first row African-Americans were allowed to sit in. A few stops later, the front four rows filled up. A white man was left standing.
> 
> **3** According to the laws of that time, African-Americans had to give up their seats to whites, so the bus driver asked Parks and the three other African-Americans to get up and move. Although the others complied, Parks refused. She later said she was not tired from work, but tired of being treated like a second-class citizen. The bus driver called the police, who arrested Parks and took her away in handcuffs.
> 
> **4** Over the weekend, a protest was organized, **and** on the following Monday, African-American people in Montgomery began a boycott of the public buses, and the boycott was tremendously successful, **and** it lasted more than a year. The Supreme Court of the United States finally ruled that segregation on public transportation was unconstitutional. African-Americans had won a huge victory, **and** they realized their power to change the system.

**Rosa Parks (revised)**

> **1.** Rosa Parks is a famous American African-American woman who is often called “the mother of the civil rights movement.” When she was born into a poor but hardworking African-American family in Alabama, no one suspected that she would become the spark that ignited the civil rights movement in the United States. This movement changed U.S. society forever by helping African-American people attain equal rights under the law.

Because they had won a huge victory, African-Americans realized their power to change the system.

## 11 Using Parallel Structures and Fixing Sentence Problems
### Parallelism
Parallelism is an important element in English writing, especially when you are listing and comparing and contrasting items or ideas. Parallelism means that each item in a list or comparison follows the same grammatical pattern. If you are writing a list and the first item in your list is noun, write all the following items as nouns also. If the first item is an *-ing* word, make all the others *-ing* words; if it is an adverb clause, make all the others adverb clauses.

In the examples that follow, the sentences in the column on the right follow the rule of parallelism.

| Not parallel                                                                                     | Parallel                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| My English conversation class is made up of Chinese, Spaniards, and some are from Bosnia         | My English conversation class is made up of Chinese, Spaniards, and Bosnians.                                                      |
| The students who do well attend class, they do their homework, and practice speaking in English. | The students who do well attend class, do their homework, and practice speaking in English.                                        |
| The teacher wanted to know which country we came from and our future goals                       | The teacher wanted to know which country we came from and what our future goals were.                                              |
| The languages skills of the students in the evening classes are the same as the day classes.     | The language skills of the students in the evening classes are the same as the language skills of the students in the day classes. |


> [!NOTE] Notes
> 1. You may substitute a pronoun for the second "the language skills" in the last example:
>    - The language skills of the students in the evening classes are the same as those of the students in the day classes.
> 2. All the words in the first item do not always have to be repeated in the second. You may repeat all or some of the words, depending on what you wish to emphasize. The following sentences are both correct:
>    - Before you write a paper or before you take a test, you must organize your thoughts.
>    - Before you write a paper of take a test, you must organize your thoughts.



## 12 Noun Clauses
A noun clause is a dependent clause that functions as a noun. A noun clause is often part of an independent clause, where it can be a subject or an object.
- What the newspaper reported the world was flat.
- People once believed that the world was flat.
A noun clause can also follow certain adjectives and nouns.
- We were happy that the semester was over.
- Who first challenged the belief that the world was flat?

There are three kinds of noun clauses:
1. *That* clause, which begin with the word *that*
2. *if/whether* clauses, which begin with the words *whether* of *if*
3. question clauses, which begin with a question word, such as *who, what, where, when* or *how*

> [!NOTE] Punctuating Noun clauses
> 1. NEVER use a comma to separate a noun caluse from the main clause.
>    - I am sure that the address is correct.
> 2. If the independent clause is a statement, put a period at the end of the entire sentence. If the independent clause is a question, put a question mark at the end of the entire sentence.
>    - Are you sure that the address is correct?



## 13 Adverb Clauses

An adverb clause is a dependent caluse that functions as an adverb. It can tell when, why, how ,how long, haw far, how often, and for what purpose something happened.
### Time subordinators

## 14 Adjective Clauses

## 15 Participial Phrases

### Use participial phrases to improve your writing style
- If you write sentences with a lot of which's, who's, and that's, consider reducing some adjectives clauses to participial phrases.
-  If you write short, choppy sentences, consider combining them by using participial phrases.
- Vary your sentence openings by occasionally starting a sentence with a participial phrase.  

>  *First-born children are often super achievers. They feel pressure to behave well and to excel in school.*
>  First-born children, who feel pressure to behave well and to excel in school, are often super achievers. 
>  First-born children, feeling pressure to behave well and to excel in school, are often super achievers.
>  Feeling pressure to behave well and to excel in school, first-born children are often super achievers.

## A The Process of Academic Writing

### Creating (Prewriting)

Choose a topic and narrow it to properly level. Example: `Environment > Pollution > Ocean Pollution > Oil spills > Effects on sea life > Sea birds `

Four useful techniques for exploring within your self are:
- Journal writing
- Listing
- Free writing
- clustering
### Planning (Outlining)
### Writing

> [!Warning] In writing
> Don't worry about grammar, puncturation, or spelling.
> A rough draft is not supposed to be perfect.

This concept is actually what I need to learn.
### Polishing

The fourth and final step in the writing process is polishing what you have written. this step is alos called revising and editing. Polishing is most successful if you do it in two stages. First, attact the big issues of content and organization (revising). Then work on the smaller issues of grammar and punctuation (editing).
#### Revising
During the first revision, do not try to correct grammar, sentence structure, spelling, or punctuation; this is proofreading, which you will do later. During the first revision, be concerned mainly with content and organization.
#### Proofreading
The second step in polishing your writing is proofreading your paper for possible errors in grammar, sentence structure, spelling and punctuation.
- Check each sentence for correctness and completeness. you should have no fragments and no choppy or run-on sentences.
- Check each sentence for a subject and a verb, subject-verb agreement, correct verb tenses, noun plurals, articles, and so on.
- Check the mechanics: punctuation, spelling, and capitalization.
- Check for incorrectly used or repeated words.
- Check for contractions (can't, isn't, I'll, and so on.)


## B Punctuation Rules

> Eat children.
> Eat, children.

### Commas
#### Introducer Commas
An introducer comma follows any element that comes in front of the first independent clause in a sentence.
1. Words
    1. Therefore, I plan to quit smoking
    2. Nervously, I threw aeay my cigarettes.
2. Phrases
    1. As a result, I feel terrible right now.
    2. After 45 years of smoking, it is not easy to quit.
    3. having smoked for 16 years, i find it difficult to quit
3. Dependent clause
    1. Because I have a chronic cough, my doctor recommended that i quit immediately.
4. Direct quotations
    1. "Stop smoking today," she advised
#### Coordinator Commas

Together with a coordinating conjunction, a comma links coordinate (equal) elements in a sentence.
- Compound sentence
    - She has a good job, yet she is always broke.
    - They were tired, so they went home early.
- Series of 3 or more words
    - He does not enjoy skiing, ice-skating, or sledding.
    - Cecille speaks English, Spanish, French, and Creole.
- Series of 3 or more phrases
    - A nurse ahs to work at night, on weekends, and on holidays.
    - We ran into the airport, checked our luggage, raced to the boarding gate, gave the attendant our boarding passes, and collapsed in our seats.
#### Inserter Commas
An inserter comma is used before and after **any element that is inserted into the middle of an independent clause.**

- Words
    - My uncle, however, refuses to quit smoking.
- Phrases
    - My father, on the other hand, has never smoked.
    - There is no point in living, according to my uncle, if you do not do what you enjoy.
- Non-restrictive phrases and clauses
    - My aunt, his wife, died of lung cancer
    - My cousins, grieving over their mother's death, resolved never to smoke.
    - My mother, who just celebrated her fiftieth birthday, enjoys an occasional cigarette.
- Reporting verbs in direct quotations
    - "I have tried to quit dozens of times," she says, "but I can't."
#### Tag Commas
A tag comma is used when adding certain elements to the end of a sentence.
- Words

    - He appears to be in good health, however.
- Phrases
    - He swims for an hour every day, for example.
    - he also plays tennis, beating me most of the time.
- Tag question
    - It is not logical, is it?
- Direct quotations
    - he laughs as he says, "I will outlive all of you."
### Semicolons

Using semicolons is not difficult if you remember that a semicolon is more like a period than a comma. It is a very strong punctuation mark. Semicolons are used in three places:
1. Between two sentences that are closely connected in idea.
2. Before conjunctive adverbs and some transition phrases when they are followed by an independent clause.
3. Between items in a series when the items themselves contain commas
#### Between sentences
Use a semicolon at the end of a sentence when the following sentence is a closely connected in meaning. You could also use a period, but when the sentences are connected in meaning, a semicolon indicates the connection.

> **Independent clause; independent clause**
> - Andrew did not accept the offer; he wants to go to graduate school.
> - Computer use is increasing; computer crime is, too.
> - The meeting ended at dawn; nothing had been decided.

#### Before connectors

**Independent clause; conjunctive adverb/ transition phrase, independent clause**

- Skiing is dangerous; nevertheless, millions of people ski.
- I have never been to Asia; in fact, I have never been outside the country.

#### Between items in series
Semicolons are used to separate items in a series when some of the items already contain commas.

> I cannot decide which car I like best; the Ferrari, with its quick acceleration and sporty look; the midsize Ford Taurus, with its comfortable seats and ease of handling; or the compact Geo, with its economical fuel consumption.

### Colons
Using a colon at the end of an independent clause focuses attention on the words following the colon. After a colon, we often write lists, appositives, and direct quotations.

#### Before lists
Use a colon to introduce a list.

- Library have two kinds of periodicals: bound periodical and current periodical.
- I need the following groceries: egg, milk, and coffee.
- The causes of the U.S Civil War were as follows: the economic domination of the North, the slavery issue, and the issue of states rights versus federal intervention.
##### Caution
Don't use a colon to introduce a list after the verb to be unless you add the following or as follows.
- ❌ To me, the most important things in life are: good health, a happy home life, and a satisfying occupation.
- To me, the most important things in life are good health, a happy home life, and a satisfying occupation.
- To me, the most important things in life are the following: good health, a happy home life, and a satisfying occupation.

Do not use a colon after a preposition. Use a colon only at the end of an independent clause.  
- ❌ After a long day at work, I look forward to: enjoying a quiet dinner at home, playing with my children, and watching a little TV.  
- After a long day at work, I look forward to enjoying a quiet dinner at home, playing with my children, and watching a little TV.
#### Before Appositives  

Use a colon after an independent clause to direct attention to an appositive (a word or word group that renames another word or word group).  
- He had one great love in his life: himself.  
- A doctor has two important abilities: the ability to listen and the ability to analyze.

#### Before long Quotations  
Use a colon to introduce a quotation longer than three lines. This type of quote is indented on both sides, and no quotation marks are used.  

> As Albert C. Baugh and Thomas Cable state in their book The History of the English Language:  
>> There is no such thing as uniformity in language. Not only does the speech of one community differ from that of another, but the speech of different individuals of a single community, even different members of the same family, is marked by individual peculiarities.
> 

#### After Formal Salutations

Use a colon after the salutation of a formal letter.

> Dear Professor Einstein:
> Dear Customer Relations:
> Dear Ms. Smith:
> To Whom It May Concern:

In informal letters, use a comma.

> Dear Mom,
> Dear Alex,

### Quotation Marks

Quotation marks `"..."` have three basic uses: to enclose direct quotations, to enclose unusual words, and to enclose titles of short works.

#### Around Direct Quotations 

Use quotation marks around a direct quotation that is shorter than three lines. A  direct quotation states the exact words of a speaker and is usually introduced by a reporting phrase such as *he said* or as the *report stated*.

Punctuation with quotation marks can be a little tricky. Here are some rules to follow:

1. Separate a quoted sentence from a reporting phrase with a comma.
	1. The receptionist said, "The doctor is unavailable right now. Please wait."
	2. "We have already been waiting for an hour", we answered.
2. Periods and commas go inside the second quotation mark of a pair.
	1. "I thought he was responsible," he said, "but he isn't."
3. Colons and semicolons go outside quotation marks.  
	1. "Give me liberty or give me death": these are famous words.
4. Exclamation points (!) and question marks (?) go inside quotation marks if they are a part of the quotation; otherwise, they go outside.  
	1. "Is it eight o'clock?" she asked.  
	2. Did she say, "It is eight o'clock"?
5. Begin each quoted sentence with a capital letter. When a quoted sentence is divided into two parts, the second part begins with a lowercase letter unless it is a new sentence.  
	1. "I thought he was responsible," he said, "but he isn't."  
	2. "I think he is responsible," he said. "look at his fine work."
6. Use single quotation marks `'...'` to enclose a quotation within a quotation.  
	1. As John F. Kennedy reminded us, "We should never forget the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., who said, 'I have a dream.'"
