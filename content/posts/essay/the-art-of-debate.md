## Background

The background is that I occasionally have a debate with Luo Huan. We always would not control the center of the topic **eventually**. So we **have both been mad at** each other. So I have to learn some necessary  skills and principles  on how to debate. Not **to protect** my opinions, only **to seek** the truth.

## Foundation of Principles

For a valid debate and make sure the progress in orderly. There are a few principles that must be followed.

- Clarify your position, including any definitions and objections.
- Set a clear goal **at the beginning of** the debate.
- Focus **on** the results of **the** debate, don't **away from** it.

## Methods

I don't have enough time to learn about the knowledge of debate, but I also get some summaries through my deeply thinking.

- Keep truth
- See what is you want to pursue
- Distinguish the people who whether is your friend or your opponent
- Make sure that you really understand the topic before debating
