I asked a seed,  

"How do you know when spring arrives?"  

When my paintbrush first dips into green,  

I know spring is about to come.  

<br>

I asked a stream,  

"How do you know where you're flowing?"  

When I look at my tail,  

I know where my end will be.  

<br>

"But I've forgotten where my paintbrush is," the seed said.  

"Can you help me find it?"  

"Of course!"  

So I buried the seed in the soil of the yard.  

<br>

"Sometimes it's so big I dare not look straight at it!" the stream exclaimed.  

"Do you know why sometimes I can't see my tail clearly?"  

"Let me think..."

It might be the tail end of countless tiny streams.
