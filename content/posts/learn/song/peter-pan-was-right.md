# "Peter Pan Was Right" lyrics

## [**Anson Seabra Lyrics**](https://www.azlyrics.com/a/ansonseabra.html)

**"Peter Pan Was Right"**

I guess Peter Pan was right

Growing up's waste of time

So I think I'll fly away

Set a course for brighter days

Find the second star, I'm soaring

Then straight to the morning

I know that I'll be fine

'Cause I know Perter Pan was right



Just a lost boy in a small town

I'm the same kids but I grown now

Try to make it out but I don't know how

With that I was young, what have I become?

Now it's late night and I'm at home

So I make friends with my shadow

And I play him all my sad, sad songs

And we don't talk but he sings song like



Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Fairytales are not the truth

What I am supposed to do? (Mm-mm, mm)



I guess Peter Pan was right

Growing up's a waste of time

So I think I'll fly away

Set a course for brighter days

Find the second star, I'm soaring

Then straight on to the morning

I know that I'll be fine

'Cause I know Peter Pan was right



Days feel like a blur now

Still feel, eighteen, but I'm burnt out

So I daydream of what I could be

If I turned back time to a storyline where my

Mom read me a tale where 

A couple kids, one girl and a sailor

Met a boy in green, I thought it'd be me

But I guess that dream wasn't meant to be like



Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Fairytales are not the truth

What am I supposed to do? (Mm-mm, mm)



I guess Peter Pan was right

Growing up's a waste of time

So I think I'll fly away

Set a course for brighter days

Find the second star, I'm soaring

Then straight on to the morning

I know that I'll be fine

'Cause I know Peter Pan was right



And I don't care if I never land

'Cause the distant sky's always better than

My life right now and the place I am

So for one last time, I guess Peter Pan



I guess Peter Pan was right

Growing up's a waste of time

So I think I'll fly away

Set a course for brighter days

Find the second star, I'm soaring

Then straight on to the morning

I know that I'll be fine

'Cause I know Peter Pan was right
