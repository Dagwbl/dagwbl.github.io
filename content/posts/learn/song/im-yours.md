# "I'm Yours" lyrics

## [**Jason Mraz Lyrics**](https://www.azlyrics.com/m/mraz.html)

**"I'm Yours"**

Well, you done done me and you bet I felt it

I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted

I fell right through the cracks

Now I'm trying to get back



Before the cool done run out

I'll be giving it my bestest

And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention

I reckon, it's again my turn

To win some or learn some



But I won't hesitate

No more, no more

It cannot wait

I'm yours



Well, open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

And look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love

Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, we're just one big family

And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved



So I won't hesitate

No more, no more

It cannot wait

I'm sure

There's no need to complicate

Our time is short

This is our fate

I'm yours



But don't you want to come on and scooch on over closer, dear

And I will nibble your ear



I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer

But my breath fogged up the glass

And so I drew a new face and I laughed



I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason

To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons

It's what we aim to do

Our name is our virtue



But I won't hesitate

No more, no more

It cannot wait

I'm yours



Well, open up your mind and see like me

Open up your plans and damn you're free

Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours

So please don't, please don't, please don't

There's no need to complicate

'Cause our time is short

This oh, this oh, this is our fate

I'm yours



Oh, I'm yours

Oh, I'm yours

Oh, oh

Baby, do believe I'm yours?

You best believe, you best believe, I'm yours

Writer(s): Jason Mraz

There was a demo version of this song included on a limited-release bonus EP "Extra Credit" (2005), which Jason Mraz used to promote his "Mr. A-Z" (2005) album.

Many covers of this track have been made and posted on YouTube. The singer told Billboard magazine, *"I never instigated any of the covers. But I can see why people are drawn to the song. And because it is about generosity, I wanted to share it."*

This song was released as the album's first single because of the fans' response to it.

This song was being performed live for about five years before its release. Jason Mraz noted, *"When I finally recorded it, my fans were relieved that we didn't overproduce it. We kept the feel and arrangement true to how we play it live."*
