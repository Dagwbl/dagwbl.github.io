Dear Sister,

Seeing the tears in your eyes made me realize how deeply saddened you are by Mom’s decision to move to Shuicheng.  

But it seems there’s nothing we can do. We’re constantly pushed forward by life’s unavoidable circumstances while trying our best to make the most of it.  

We’ve grown accustomed to being children, unwilling to face the separation of our big family, and wanting to keep it intact. You’ve always been the one who spent the most time with Mom and Dad, so of course, you’re also the one who finds it hardest to let go.  

Things are always changing—some changes may bring us comfort, while others may bring pain. We naturally prefer staying in our comfort zones, but the more people and things involved, the harder it becomes to maintain that comfort.  

What I want to say is, this might not necessarily be a bad thing. Although it may seem like Mom is the one who will struggle the most with the adjustment, society is evolving, and we must actively adapt to keep up with the times.  

Mom and Dad, you and your husband, Manman and Ningning—all of us will eventually leave this place, whether in a few years or a decade or so. This land can no longer provide the stable, happy life we desire. Moreover, we may have hopes, dreams, and aspirations that this place simply can’t fulfill.  

So, having the opportunity to leave is, in my opinion, a good thing. At the very least, we’ll gain access to slightly better healthcare, education, and other modern conveniences.  

Of course, you already understand all this. What I also want to say is: physical distance won’t weaken the emotional bonds between us. With today’s advanced communication tools, no matter where we are, we can always stay connected. And if the need arises, we can be by each other’s side in no time. In fact, this might give us more places to call home and allow our children and parents to experience more of life—after all, life is about experiences.  

So don’t be sad. The difficulties are only temporary. Being apart from our parents will make us stronger and braver, better equipped to face and overcome life’s challenges. In doing so, we’ll embody their spirit, just as they did, and become role models for our own children.  

Sige, Panguan, Hongguo, Shuicheng—none of these places are really that far away. We’re all just leaving home for a little while, and we’ll all return to this place eventually. This big family will always be here.  

Wishing you all the best.
