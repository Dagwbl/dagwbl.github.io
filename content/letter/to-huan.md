欢：

最近过得不是很好，总觉得自己像是一坛腌菜一样，笼罩在一种很压抑的情绪之中。

The rest of the words is in the paper.

### 欢欢

你好啊，希望你点进来之前有一些惊喜，点进来之后也是。这是我上个月搭建的博客网站，用来记录一些东西。之前的服务器过期了没有再续费，也没时间整理。我想将我们之间的信件放在这里是合适的，我设置了搜索隐藏，只有有链接的人才能找到。

前些天听到一首很好听的歌，当时忍住没给你分享，就是等到现在。不出意外你应该已经听到了。

你写字好漂亮！近期最开心的一刻就是拿到你的信件的那一刻。

看来你的愿望马上就要实现了，非常替你感到开心，照顾好爱自己的人真的是一件特别难得的事情，我一直都做得很差劲，哎。

我最近一直都感觉时间不够，效率也不够高，很是焦虑。这两晚都睡得很晚，晚上想着睡早点又担心想着一天都没干啥，想多学一会明天又会没精神。计划这个月末参加一次考试试试水，根据目前的情况多半还是不会过。老师一直在push我。

最近发现一个补充能量的地方——晚上的广场或公园，尤其是有许多人跳广场舞的地方。我可以坐在旁边自顾自的干自己的事情而全然不顾他们的眼光，就像我是他们的同伴一样，只是我没有参与他们跳舞。

最后，关于你提到的字少的问题，我想这压根不是一个问题。我们可以只说一句话，甚至是不说话。我们也可以待时机成熟时将我们各自记录多年或珍藏多年的东西拿出来分享，不要让我们之间的交流有任何的压力。

安！

Hi, I hope you had some surprises before you clicked in and afterward. This is a blog site I set up last month to keep track of things. The previous server expired and wasn't renewed and I didn't have time to organize it. I thought it would be appropriate to put our correspondence here, and I set up a `searchhide` param for this letter,  it so that only people with a link can find it.

Your handwriting is so beautiful! One of the happiest moments in recent memory was the moment I got your letter.

It looks like your wish is coming true soon, very happy for you, taking care of someone who loves you is really a particularly rare thing to do, and I've been doing it so poorly, oops.

I've been feeling anxious lately about not having enough time and not being productive enough. These two nights are sleeping very late, the night thought of sleeping early and worried about thinking about the day did not do anything, want to study a little more tomorrow will be no spirit. I plan to take a test at the end of this month to similar the eaxm, according to the current situation most likely still will not pass. My teacher has been pushing me.

Recently I found a place to replenish my energy - a square or park at night, especially where there are a lot of people dancing. I can sit next to them and do my own thing without a care in the world, like I'm their companion, except I'm not participating in their dancing.

Finally, regarding your mention of fewer words on your letter, I don't think that's a problem at all. We can say just one word, or even no words at all. We can also when the time is right bring out and share what we have each recorded for years or treasured for years. Please don't feel any pressure on us to communicate with each other.

I heard a great song the other day and resisted sharing it with you then, just until now. No surprise you should have heard it already.
