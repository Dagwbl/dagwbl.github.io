Good evening, Luis.
Thanks for your concern. My tummy often feels not good after it gets cold. This morning I felt too warm, so I took my coat off.

I want to say sorry to you for rejecting your lunch noon, even though you might think that it doesn't matter at all.

I'm afraid you might overthink it(something like I don't like your lunch). I rejected you because I think you guys didn't have too much food, and we have a strange culture which is called polite refusal. Sometimes we even find other reasons to reject others. I don't like it, whereas I have this habit.

I hope you weren't overthinking about this. Your lunch looked good and delicious, especially, that it looked like pizza or omelette. I'm glad to try it next time if you have some extra food.

And I also hope you don't mind this long message. I was going to tell you tomorrow, nevertheless this thing occupies my mind now.

I also want to use this opportunity to boost my writing skills in English.
Anyway, have a good night.

Hi Jinpeng, no worries! I was not overthinking. I happy to share that space with you guys. Yes there may be people from another cultures who overthinking too much 😂,  it was ok for me. I didn’t found it disrespectful or anything bad. Anyway thank you for telling me ! I appreciate it
