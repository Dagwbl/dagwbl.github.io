Dear Professor Liu,

I hope this email finds you well.

With the CSC application process commencing next month, I am writing to update you on our preparation progress and seek your guidance regarding some potential challenges we have identified.

1. Preference Consideration of Guizhou Province Department of Education:  
    According to our research, Guizhou Province Department of Education tends to prioritize applicants from major state-owned enterprises. While this is not an official requirement, it might influence the evaluation process.
    
2. Social Security Documentation:  
    A continuous six-month social security payment record is strongly recommended, though not formally required. Due to my recent career transition (I left my previous position to focus on overseas study preparations), there is currently a gap in my employment records. Professor Hu is assisting me in addressing this matter through alternative documentation.
    
3. Alternative Application Channel:  
    We are currently consulting with relevant departments at Guizhou University to explore potential institutional endorsement opportunities. I will keep you updated on any developments.
    

Despite these challenges, we remain committed to submitting the possible application. 
In addition, there are some required Information from your side. Could I kindly request you to provide the following information as the picture shows when convenient, any language is okay:  
![](../../images/Pasted%20image%2020250213110504.png)
> 1. your **professional and technical title** and your **position**.

> 3. Work experience, main research areas, works published and important papers published in the past five years, key scientific research projects hosted, and important academic achievements and rewards obtained; cooperation with foreign institutions/mentors.

Your expert advice on optimizing our application strategy would be greatly appreciated.

Wishing you a prosperous Year of the Snake.

Best regards,

I quit my previous job due to it is impossible that go aboard from previous job. I've had a few months before is the umemployed status. therefore I cannot meet this demand.
