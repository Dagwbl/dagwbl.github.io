**Dear Zhuzhu,**  

Coming to my home has hurt you deeply, and seeing you in pain makes my heart ache as well. I’ve never believed that marriage must have parental blessings to be happy—happiness is something we define for ourselves. Our relationship, including the decision to marry, was made thoughtfully by the two of us. How many of our parents' generation married for love? At least my parents didn’t. My father, in particular, carries more of a sense of responsibility than love. Perhaps his perspective has limited his ability to recognize or feel love, but that doesn’t mean our happiness needs his approval.  

Regarding the word "disdain," I want to apologize. Those words were hurtful, but my father wouldn’t truly act that way in reality. Later, I also realized he knew he was wrong—unfortunately, he doesn’t know how to apologize or admit fault, maybe because of his pride as an elder. If he truly behaved that way toward your family, I would choose to distance myself from him. I don’t expect him to accept us. I’ll consciously dismiss his unreasonable, negative remarks as just words—nothing more—and not let them weigh on my heart or make you suffer. No matter what happens, I’ll remain as firm as I was last night, standing my ground without hesitation. Whatever comes next, leave it to me.  

I love your home, Zhuzhu. Your parents, your brother and sister—they’re warm and optimistic. That lively, joyful atmosphere is something I’ve never experienced in my own family. Ours has always been so quiet and cold, which is why holidays never meant much to me—until I came to your home. Here, I finally felt the warmth and liveliness of a family. I adore every one of them, and these past few days have been so comfortable and freeing for me. The only thing on my mind was how I could contribute.  

During my time here, I’ve seen your mother rise early to light the stove, watched the children gather happily around the table to eat, and noticed the busy yet cheerful smiles. I’ve seen your father holding little Yubao with such joy and reluctance in his eyes. I’ve heard your sister affectionately call out to Dalong and Dapeng, as if catching a glimpse of your childhood—Manman and Ningning’s laughter and playfulness, so innocent and carefree. All of this feels like a distant dream to me, a precious experience I’ve never had. That night on the rooftop, bathed in starlight and mist, my heart began to long for this kind of life and beauty. Because of you, I suddenly see family life in vibrant color, breaking through the rigid black-and-white order of my own home.  

Last night, seeing you cry and feeling heartbroken for your mother—I understand completely. When someone spoke poorly of my mother before, I felt the same pain. It hurts to think of everything she’s done for others in her life, only to be looked down upon or disliked because of one wrong decision. Even if it were my grandfather, I would speak up for her. Our mothers are ordinary yet extraordinary—kind-hearted, hardworking, and endlessly giving for their families. Their bright laughter is one of the most precious things in this world!  

**Love,**  
[Your Name]

Zhu Zhu, our future is our own, it lies within us, so don't be afraid. No matter what happens, I will stand firmly by your side to face all uncertainties and challenges together. We will grow, progress, and move forward hand in hand, so don't be afraid!
