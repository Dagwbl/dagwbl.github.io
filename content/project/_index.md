## Readme for PARA

**structures**: This folder is organized by reference to the PARA method.

The traditional PARA method is complex and not suitable for ordinary individuals. It uses file-level methods to align and simplify it, leaving Archive out of the way. The directory is as follows.

```bash
├─project 1
└─project 2
    ├─section
        └─section 1.md
        └─section 2.md
    └─resource
        └─references or personal products
    └─index.md
```
