- **PhD Research Focus**:  
  Specializing in **Intelligent Mine Safety and Sustainable Mining**, with proposed thesis topic:  
  > **`[e.g., AI-Driven Rockburst Hazard Prediction in Deep Metal Mines]`**  
  Aiming to mitigate geotechnical risks in deep mining and enhance operational safety/resource efficiency.


### 2. Rationale for Choosing University of Alberta  
- **Global Leadership in Mining Engineering**:  
  Hosts Canada’s **largest mining engineering department** with unique facilities (e.g., **Oil Sands Tailings Research Facility**).  
- **Supervisor Alignment**:  
  Will conduct research under **Prof. Wei Victor Liu**, whose work on **sustainable cement-based materials**, **geothermal modeling**, **mining engineering** directly support my objectives.  
- **Industry Integration**:  
  Strategic partnerships with **Syncrude, Suncor Energy** provide access to field data from active mines.

### 3. Detailed Research Plan (4-Year Timeline)  

| **Period**   | **Excepted work**                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The 1st year | Literature review, prepare samples, start experiments of WRI. Base software and knowledge learning, IoT system of sand box designing.                         |
| The 2nd year | Experiment data analysis, dynamic fracture network modeling, collection, and validation using experiment data, start experiments related to fracture network. |
| The 3rd year | Coupled Hydra-Chemical-Heat-Fracture model building, optimization analysis.                                                                                   |
| The 4th year | Final model refinements, scenario simulations, writing of dissertation, and publications.                                                                     |

### 4. Financial Support  
- **Funding Source**:  
  Awarded full scholarship from **China Scholarship Council (CSC)** (Award No. 202508530144), covering:  
  ✅ Tuition waived  
  ✅ Living allowance (CA$2,200/month)  
  ✅ Health insurance & round-trip airfare  
- **Documentation**:  
  Attached: CSC Award Letter + UAlberta Tuition Fee Schedule (See Annex).

### 5. Post-Study Plan (Critical Section)  
- **Legal Obligation**:  
  **Per Article X of the CSC Agreement, I must return to China for at least 2 years of service upon degree completion.**  
- **Career Objectives**:  
  Secure faculty position at **`[e.g., University of Science and Technology Beijing]`**, specifically:  
  ▶ To join the **Key Laboratory of Intelligent Mining for Metal Mines (MOE)** addressing China’s deep mining challenges;  
  ▶ Apply PhD research to reduce rockburst accidents in Chinese metal mines (producing >70% national output).  
- **Alignment with National Priorities**:  
  Research supports **China’s 14th Five-Year Plan on Mine Safety**, emphasizing "intelligent mines" and "major hazard prevention".  
- **Family Ties**:  
  Parents reside permanently in `[City]`; `[spouse/children will remain/join temporarily]` – all social ties rooted in China.

### 6. Declaration  
I solemnly declare that my sole purpose in Canada is to pursue doctoral studies at the University of Alberta. My CSC funding ensures financial stability, and I will strictly fulfill my return service obligation to contribute to China’s mining sector.  

**Signature**: ________________  
**Date**: `[Submission Date]`

### ✅ Key Enhancements for Visa Success:
1. **Technical Neutrality**:  
   Add footnote: *"This research focuses exclusively on civilian mining safety applications."*  
2. **Supervisor Endorsement**:  
   Include supervisor’s signed letter confirming:  
   *"The candidate’s work on AI-based hazard prediction is purely academic and aligns with CSC regulations."*  
3. **Evidence of Ties to China**:  
   Attach notarized proof of family assets (property deeds) or employment intent letters from Chinese institutions.  
4. **Terminology Consistency**:  
   Use **"geotechnical risk mitigation"** instead of "critical infrastructure protection" in all documents.
