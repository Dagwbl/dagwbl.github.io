## 08:32 Got up after playing on my phone for a long time

Woke up in the morning, took a shower, and tossed my dirty clothes into the washing machine. Sniffed the rice I cooked on Friday night—no weird smell yet—so I stir-fried it with some potatoes and eggs.

## 09:35 Checked CSC and talent recruitment programs

Time flies—it’s almost mid-May already. Just opened the CSC website, and as expected, no results yet. Then I checked the talent expo website for updates on the talent recruitment progress—same deal, not even an interview notice.  

Started feeling anxious again, unsure of what to do next.  

QQ Music recommended a song called "Don’t Panic, There’s Moonlight After Sunset." The singer moaned lyrics like:  

> Don’t be lost~  
> Don’t panic~  
> ……  
> Don’t waver~  
> Don’t be disheartened~  

It genuinely annoyed me. These verb-object structures made up entirely of negative words—if you just listen to it as background music, all you hear is *don’t, lost, panic, disheartened, be lost*, and so on. For someone who isn’t lost, panicked, wavering, or disheartened, it might not seem off. But for someone actually feeling those emotions, it’s nothing but irritating.  

## 21:36 Streetlight landmarks  

Made a cold-tossed lettuce and stir-fried cabbage for dinner—ate too much. Decided to go for a walk and called my mom while on Kang Le Road to ask if she wanted to join. She said sure.  

Ended up lecturing her the whole evening. At first, I pointed out the municipal government bus stop to her. She studied it carefully and said she could use the nearby postal newsstand as a landmark. I said those things are everywhere. Then she suggested using a forked roadside tree as a marker.  

I said, "There are so many trees—you might as well use the streetlights as landmarks." Of course, I was being sarcastic, but she took it seriously and started taking photos of the lampposts with her phone.  

I was torn between laughing and facepalming. I said, "What about the China Agricultural Development Bank right there?" Then I explained that landmarks should be things like malls, schools, hospitals, or intersections.  

## 22:01 Buying mangoes  

I’d been wanting to buy some mangoes since yesterday, but my mom said they weren’t good—the ones with a bit of red on the skin taste better. When we passed by the fruit stand earlier, I almost bought some but held back, afraid she’d nag me.  

After passing the stadium, I saw another vendor with a cart selling mangoes. They weren’t expensive and looked fresh, so I decided to buy a few. As soon as I asked the vendor, my mom predictably started up: "These don’t taste good, why waste money," blah blah blah...  

It really got on my nerves. I bought them anyway, and after walking a bit, I started lecturing her. I said, "I just want to eat them now. They’re not expensive, and I’m not buying a ton. Do you have to keep nagging?"  

Then I took one out of the bag and handed it to her. "Try it. Is it really that bad? Is it worth the price?"  
She stopped talking after that.  

Later, I told Huanhuan about it, and she said I sometimes do the same—judging her based on my own experiences and opinions. I thought about it, and she’s right.
