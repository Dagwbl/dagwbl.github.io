### 07:48 Didn't Sleep Well Again Last Night  

Woke up before six this morning, feeling pretty rough.  

It’s my first time renting a car, and without an experienced driver by my side, I’m a little nervous.  

Spent quite a while learning online, now ready to get up.  

### Driving Home  

At 9 a.m., Huanhuan and I went to pick up the car—a Chevrolet Cruze. This car rolls back a bit, which is slightly scary.  

Thanks to some prior practice, we calmly drove it into Huanhuan’s family courtyard.  

Packed our stuff into the trunk and set off. The drive went smoothly overall—my first time driving this far alone, including on the highway.

In the afternoon after arriving home, they mentioned wanting to go play by the river again. So, along with Fourth Uncle, we drove everyone to the riverside. Having a car is quite convenient, though the rough roads still make it easy to scrape the undercarriage. But with all the insurance we’ve bought, it’s no big deal.
