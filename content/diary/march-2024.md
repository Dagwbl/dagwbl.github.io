Pay attention to why you are using tools, rather than just focusing on the tools themselves.

## Mar 21

Today, I will have a sweet dream, because I did an hour working out. Additionally, I didn't get sleep all day.

When I got back to the dormitory after getting off work, I met Li Yujie on the first floor of the apartment.
I had taken a delivery first. And then I took my delivery going upstairs by elevator. I saw Li Yujie standing outside of my dormitory when I got to my floor.

There was a bag of **wolfberry** in her hand. I invited her to have dinner together after I accepted the wolfberry.

Next, I boiled two bowls of noodles and a fennel egg cake to share with her. Last but not least, she shared a game with me. We played by ourselves for an hour.

To end with, I went to our gym to play dynamic bike.

## Mar 20

Last night, I cannot fallen asleep on time. Till a half past 3 A.M, I was awaking. There is a lot of thoughts in my mind. Especially some things like the passion or relationship.

I think what I supposed to do is that make some changes.

## Mar 19

> The more I worked for other people, the more I wanted to be my own boss.

### Duolingo's sentences

- Did you hear that the teacher had to suspend Kevin from school for **stealing**?
- They **were** holding hands.
- The **worse** the boss treats me, the more I want to retire.
- I guess I shouldn't treat myself **so** badly.

Today, I finished the function that compatible with both Github and Gitee simultaneously.

## Mar 18

Today, I feel extremely tired. and I seldom learn to speak or listen all day. The only today's achievement is that I finished building my personal blog by Github. The most interesting thing is that I tried to use the workflow function of Github, and then I successfully dealt with a bug.

And one more thing, I really don't want to listen these things Luo Huan talked about her ex-boyfriend. I felt uncomfortable and uncareful. Honestly, I just care about her situation, not other people about her. However, just these poo things resulted in her bad mood. And I want to use a comment to describe her.

> I tried to walk out of the swamp that has trapped me for so long, but forgot why this swamp has held me for so long.

Today's emoji is :upside_down_face: , :nauseated_face: and :anguished:

### My little cousin

My little cousin is one of my best **friends.** Actually, we don't have any **blood relationships.** We had known each other **is** when I was **in junior** high school.

Though we had just been in contact for one year, we have **built** **a** very strong relationship. She named me little cousin(brother) when I named her **little** cousin(sister). We **are** frequently outspoken to each other without reservation.

Today, We have **known** each other already for ten years. In my mind, I think she is a very clever and lovely girl. Of **course**, I don't know **my** imagination **of mine** in her mind.

Just now, she sent a few messages talking about her current situation. She has lots of stress **on** her thesis. After she told ~~to~~ me and I gave her some **needed** interaction, She felt better.

### Huan with her ex-boyfriend

Just a few minutes ago, Huan called me about how he broke up with her ex-boyfriend.

However, I cannot give her any specific suggestions. She felt extremely upset, and she wanted to give her ex-boyfriend a callback.

In my opinion, it is unnecessary to call him back There is no actual love between you and him.

So, from other perspectives, choosing to break up might not be a bad result.

Custom the website to fit the syntax of typora.

==double equals== ,<mark>use the `<mark>` label</mark>

Woops, I cannot solve the mark compatibility between Typora and Hugo.

### About My Present situation

My heart is under a lot of pressure, causing me to feel short of breath.

I hope to discover a way to accomplish some purpose or find life's truth and significance.

A few days ago, I took a psychological test for the individual pressure of my mind. It demonstrated I had too much stress so I scored 113. The result means my pressure has been inducing my bodily disease.

Therefore, I think what I am supposed to do is adjust my lifestyle and alter my attitude.

## Mar 15

Tonight, I spent tw<mark>e</mark> precious hours ~~for~~ managing my blog website of Hugo.
The reason why the process is so ~~much~~ difficult **is** that I didn't understand the meaning of the ~~below~~ code.

So, the most important experience is that we must carefully treat any tips, warn~~n~~ings, and precurors.

```shell
Error: command error: failed to load config: "D:\blog\hugo.yaml:226:1": failed to unmarshal YAML: yaml: line 226: mapping values are not allowed in this context
```
