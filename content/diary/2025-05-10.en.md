Last night, it rained heavily for a long time. When I woke up this morning, the temperature was particularly low, so we stayed in the room and played for quite a while.  

In the morning, Xiaohuanhuan had to work overtime, so I stayed in bed by myself, playing on my phone until noon.  

Around two o'clock, I decided to visit my grandfather at my second uncle's house. I checked the map and strolled over leisurely. On the way, I stopped by the supermarket near the neighborhood to buy some soy milk powder and regular milk, then spent a simple half-hour there.  

I always feel a bit uneasy when visiting other people's homes, and I can sense their discomfort too—probably because we're not very familiar with each other.  

Yesterday, Huanhuan's mom told her mother-in-law that we wanted to eat bamboo shoots. After Huanhuan got off work, we took an unofficial taxi to Chengguan, bought some cakes and drinks, and headed over. Huanhuan's grandmother had already stewed the bamboo shoots with pork ribs until they were rich, tender, and falling apart. My mouth watered so much that I couldn’t resist lifting the lid to peek twice.  

After dinner, we went out again to buy a watermelon—2.5 yuan per jin, and it was quite sweet. These days, watermelons are already flooding the market, so they’re not out-of-season ones.
