### 11:02 Totally Blind  

The website's Sitemap kept generating empty files, and I spent time troubleshooting the issue. After a round of debugging, I realized the `disable` flag in the configuration file was set to `true`. The local `hugo.yaml` had already been changed to `false`, but I still wasted two hours.  

```yaml
sitemap:
  changefreq: always
  disable: false
  priority: 0.8
```  

### 11:49 After Eating Liangfen  

`pre-commit` always makes me wait forever during submissions, and the `node_modules` directory also slows down Obsidian's startup. So, I deleted it.  

I also removed Front Matter (CMS). Obsidian itself is already sufficient—no need to chase after redundant tools.  

### 14:46 Trying to Shelve My Thoughts  

I couldn’t fall asleep at noon, thinking about learning `Sass` and `Tailwind CSS`, wondering why lunch wasn’t over yet, and stressing over things like the provincial civil service exam (CSC). These thoughts swirled in my head, and in the end, I didn’t sleep at all.  

There’s no need to learn so many things—time is limited. Mastering basic CSS is enough for me. Why bother with more? I’m not someone who makes a living as a front-end developer. What I need now is a way to earn a living, or at least something that brings me peace of mind.  

### 19:49 After Dinner  

So many thoughts.  

Yesterday, I bought liangfen and liangpi, and it took me the whole day to finish them today. But these things aren’t filling—they’re mostly water, so I got hungry again quickly. Then, my stomach took control of my brain, ordering my mouth to eat an ice cream, a ham sausage, a fried egg, and a pot of vegetables.  

Supermarket eggs are ridiculously cheap—only 3.99 yuan per pound—so I quickly put the packaged eggs in my cart back on the shelf.  

Later, my mom asked me to go for a walk, but I was too lazy to move, so I told her to come to me instead.  

### 21:42 Back from a Walk with Mom  

I always get super hungry after walks. Came back and ate some fruit and bread—so much for losing weight.  

### 22:14 Finished Writing a Reply to Huanhuan About Charlie

When similar incidents occur around us, there are many issues worth reflecting upon.
