Today was a very special day.  

Huanhuan and I played *Split fiction all day long, skipping breakfast. Suddenly, hot dogs appeared in the game, making us crave them so badly that Huanhuan quickly steamed two zongzi for us to eat.  

As it got dark, we went out for a walk, thinking about buying some delicious grilled sausages. But we couldn’t find any. There was a single dried-out one at a *Meiyijia* convenience store, but we didn’t buy it.  

We walked really, really far. Later, we suddenly felt like eating oysters and drinking Coke. We found a barbecue shop that said they had them, so we went in and ordered four while we waited.  

After half an hour, the food ended up being served to another table, which made us a little upset. We walked around some more and found another place that was even cheaper. We ordered a dozen right away, but they weren’t very tasty. Maybe next time we should just make them ourselves.
