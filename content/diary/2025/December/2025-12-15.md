I’m very happy today because I received my iPad from a new account offer of RBC bank.

I haven't been so happy for a long time for an electrical device. I was exploring as much as possible under my curiosity.

I told Huan that I became a fan to apple from a pedestrian. I want to save some money to buy an iPhone and a MacBook.

The style of apple likes a concentrated and professional engineer whom I admire for. Keep restraint but don't be rigid.

I recommended Huan to use Journal application to write diary next year, and I found that she opened many subscriptions with expensive fees but seldom uses them in the Apple Store before. I was very angry for this and I think this means that she didn’t already have more attention to her money, however, she don’t have any savings with working for five years.

I cannot imagine she didn’t check her monthly payments at all before; only making payments and return credit cards in her life. From an engineering perspective, This is not a good habit. The PDCA cycle only has P and D.

Huan: if you read this diary, you should search the PDCA to understand what I said. I believe it is easy for you.

I’m trying to use the screen keyboard of iPad to input. This is the first diary typed by my iPad.
