### 🕒 00:27 | Smooth iPad Shortcut

I successfully created a very smooth **iPad shortcut**. This record was actually added using it!

### 🕒 01:01 | First Priority

The first thing I want to do is show this shortcut to Huan. I can now **clip content from any app** directly into Obsidian and record text manually via the notification bar. #shortcut

Today, I **roasted a large turkey** and four pork legs to prep for the coming days. They turned out pretty well!

### 🕒 02:00 | Manual Input

Congratulations to me! I’ve figured out how to **insert content into Obsidian** manually, just like the iPad shortcut.

### 🕒 03:11 | Good night 🌇

### 🕒 03:12 | Formatting

Don’t worry about the format for now!! I’ll leave that until the very end.

### 🕒 16:22 | Freezing Cold

Dr. Zhao messaged me to see if I wanted to go shopping at **Southgate Mall**. It is freezing today; the wind is so sharp it actually **hurts my face**.

Before he arrived, I stopped by **Dollarama** to pick up a spoon and some adhesive tape.

After shopping, we grabbed some drinks at **Starbucks**. Dr. Zhao recommended that I try the **Pink Drink**.

### 🕒 19:23 | Noise Issues
