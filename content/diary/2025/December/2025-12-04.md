In the morning, I **submitted RFI #7**. At noon, we had our **mining engineering class**, where the instructor gave us a final review. I **don't care for this teacher** and find his explanations to be **confusing and disorganized**.

After the mining class, I had to prepare for the **concrete exam** that evening. I felt completely **overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content** and didn't know where to start studying.

The first **three hours flew by quickly**, and then the **two and a half hours** I had left before the exam also **vanished rapidly**.

Unsurprisingly, **I did not perform well on the exam**. I feel terrible about it.
