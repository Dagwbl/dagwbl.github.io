### 00:15 Starting with Mastodon

I recommended Huan to register a Chinese Mastodon instance, and tried to let her know what is mastodon.

Besides, I am trying to integrate our toots on Mastodon into this Hugo blog.

I need to learn more and output more.

### 00:38 Code with Agent

It's easy for us to achieve a function that we want to do now.

### 02:23 Good night


### 12:00 Integrating fetch Mastodon data into workflow

It can now automatically fetch mastodon data into our Hugo page every day.

I'm looking forward to seeing Huan at here.
