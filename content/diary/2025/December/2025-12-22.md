I think I can use the posts on mastodon to instead of my #diary . But I think I also need to record other status for every day, and I like the recalling and summarizing process at night. So, I will insist on opening #obsidian to write diary every day, but only for the end of the day.

Other time or some moments I can directly post on #mastodon .

Ohh, right, I went to the building office to file a complaint about #noise , because I couldn’t fall asleep during whole night, and meanwhile I become more irritated by the high frequency noise.

Fortunately, the technician came my suite on time and reduced the volume of the noise at last. But it noise still exists, I can feel it every second.
