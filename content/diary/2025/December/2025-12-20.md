Logseq doesn’t suit to record diary yet, which is too much trouble and unstable. It will take a lot of time to resolve it when bugs occur. Maybe the best way to use it is only writing learning notes with zotero. #logseq

It’s easy to read and write side by side with the iPad, and easy to insert attachment. [[Obsidian]] is the best application to edit text. #app 

I got [[insomnia]] last night so too worn out now.

### 11:00 Ohhhhh

Too easy to insert time in [[obsidian]]. And it has the more powerful template plugin; I don’t think Logseq can catch up to Obsidian some day.
