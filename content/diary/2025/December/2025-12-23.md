I got up early today, so I felt today is relatively full filling.

I did my dirty laundry and I realized the #dryer has other benefits such as filtering the dust. After laundry I cooked lunch and studied for a short while.

And then I think I can invite Jian to have a fried chicken for dinner, he wanted to go airport outlets mall to return a clothe he bought before. So we went and spent a lot of money. I bought a sweater and a pair of boots for me, a sweater for Huan.

We ordered two Seoul fried chicken and brought them to Jian’s home. It’s a beautiful night with chicken and beer.

After that, we use projector to play a movie called Nobodies (浪浪山小妖怪), it’s a restful night. Huan was calling with me during 701 bus.
