In the morning, I was working on **RFI 7** for the course _Concrete Materials in Practice_. Around noon, I had my **Principles of Mining Engineering** class.

During lunch, Amir **took the initiative** to offer me a spoonful of curry.

The dynamics between us are definitely **better than before**. Amir and I are building a **new, stable relationship**, which is making me feel **much more comfortable**.

For dinner, I boiled a bag of **instant noodles** and fried some **French fries**. Afterward, I finished RFI 7 by **remotely controlling** a PC in the office.
