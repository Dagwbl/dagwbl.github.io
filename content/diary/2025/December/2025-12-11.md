This morning, Chat invited me to have coffee as soon as he arrived at the office. So, he, Jian, and I ended up talking for about **30 minutes**, which made us start our **lunch an hour late**.

I spent the majority of the day working on **Huan's visa application**, which is proving to be a bit **annoying** and complicated.

I am struggling to understand my roommate's actions. I noticed that the apartment temperature had been set to the **lowest possible setting**, meaning the **heat was completely turned off**. It is **bitterly cold** outside today—nearly $-25^{\circ}\text{C}$!

I've had the heat running for **five hours** now, and yet, the apartment is **still cold**.
