- I found a plenty of personal blog in English, at [[@Ye Olde Blogroll - Because blogs are the soul of the web]] #blog
- Another thing is that I registered Mastodon and realized it is a very pure platform nowadays. #mastodon
- Syncing my notes on different types of devices is very strolling, so I prefer to migrate to apple environments even more in the future. I spent a lot of time on strolling syncing between different devices today. After school I went to the apple store again, and explored MacBook and iPhone 17 series. I prefer MacBook Pro 14 inch and iPhone 17 pro black, but I think MacBook Pro 14 is a little weighted. #sync #apple

- I just killed a mouse; I’m not feeling well now. I found it at my kitchen yesterday, which was a little mouse. I would feel it likes me in some aspects. It tried to live in this harsh and lonely place as well as I do. #death #longly
- The Files manager of ios is a bullshit totally. I even cannot find an app to edit my plain text. I hate Apple now!!! The logseq is not mature enough, too many bugs. #ios 
- Logseq cannot have the title property, damn it. So stupid!! #logseq
