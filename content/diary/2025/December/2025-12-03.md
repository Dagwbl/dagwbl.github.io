This morning, I **polished and submitted RFI 7** for the _Concrete Materials in Practice_ course.

In the afternoon, I focused on **reviewing class lectures** to prepare for my final exam.

I attempted to use **Copilot** to develop a **Zotero plugin** that would export vocabulary words directly to Eudic, but unfortunately, it **performed very poorly** (or **didn't deliver good results**).

After finishing my work, Amir and I made our **first-ever trip to the Cameron Library**.

**Summary of Polish:**

- **"I polished and submitted the RFI 7 of Concrete Materials in Practice"** shortened slightly to **"I polished and submitted RFI 7 for the _Concrete Materials in Practice_ course"** (Clearer flow).
    
- **"Afternoon, I reviewed the class lectures for preparing the final exam"** changed to **"In the afternoon, I focused on reviewing class lectures to prepare for my final exam"** (Improved transition and verb choice).
    
- **"I wanted let Copilot to develop a Zotero plugin..."** changed to **"I attempted to use Copilot to develop a Zotero plugin..."** (More precise verb).
    
- **"it did really bad"** changed to **"it performed very poorly (or didn't deliver good results)"** (More formal and polished phrasing).
    
- **"Amir and I first time went to the Cameron library"** changed to **"Amir and I made our first-ever trip to the Cameron Library"** (More idiomatic and emphasizes the novelty).
