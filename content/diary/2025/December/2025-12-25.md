Translation:

Today is a day worth recording, because today I went out to watch a movie by myself.

A couple of days ago, I shared a video with Huan showing the magnificent scenery across Canada. Combined with the fact that I’ve been staying cooped up in my small room all this time, it gave me that feeling Sa Beining once described—like I’ve “lived in vain.”

Today is Christmas, and it’s also the New Year here. I wanted to go out and do something, but I didn’t have any particular destination in mind. Gemini suggested that I could go watch a movie, and I really liked that idea, so I decided to buy a movie ticket. I originally planned to buy one for 3:30, but then I remembered that Huan would wake up at 4:30 and I wanted to call her, so I bought a ticket for 6:30 instead. By the time I left, it was already very dark. I had wanted to take a look at the lake nearby, but that didn’t work out either.

Because there were no subtitles, I didn’t fully understand many of the details. Maybe it was also because I didn’t have anyone with me—being happy alone leaves no one to share it with—so I simply didn’t end up feeling happy at all.

Winter in Canada really isn’t an easy time. It feels like winter makes people become cold and indifferent.


今天是值得记录的一天，因为今天自己一个人出去看电影了。

前两天给欢分享一个视频，加拿大各地壮美的景色，再结合自己始终蜗居在自己的小房间，就有种感觉撒贝宁说的那种白活了的感觉。

今天是圣诞节，也是这边的新年。玩还是想着出去逛逛，但是没啥特别好的目的。Gemini 建议玩可以去看电影，玩很喜欢这个提议，然后就决定买张电影票看电影。本来想买 3 点半的，但是想着欢欢 4 点半起床要和欢欢打电话，于是买了六点半的。出门的时候天已经非常黑了，本想去看看他旁边的那个湖，也看不成了。

因为没有字幕，许多细节没有理解很清楚。也可能是没有伙伴，自己一个人快乐也没人分享，所以干脆就不产生快乐情绪了。

加拿大的冬天确实不是好日子，感觉冬天让人都变得冷漠。
