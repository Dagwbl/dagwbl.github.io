Today was a **fulfilling day**!

I **woke up early** and found that my preparation time was much shorter than usual, thanks to having the **microwave**.

I spent the morning finalizing the slides for our **group presentation**. As is often the case, I didn't enjoy the group meeting, and I realized I might have a somewhat **unhelpful mindset**.

I'm constantly **worried about the professor's judgment** of me. Worse, I find myself adding my own **negative personal thoughts** to what I imagine the professors think, which then **reflects negatively back onto myself**. This cycle leads me to **underestimate and doubt my own abilities**. This process is genuinely **damaging** to my self-esteem.

After the group meeting, I walked over to the university pharmacy to get a **flu shot**. I realized that I'm becoming increasingly capable of **handling things on my own**, which is a great feeling. I'm truly **doing well**!

I also managed to complete some parts of **RFI 7** with the help of the **Claude Opus agent**. It's only when I actively use these technologies that I truly grasp their **power and capability**.

### Summary of Polish:

- **"I took shorter preparing time than before due to having a microwave"** changed to **"my preparation time was much shorter than usual, thanks to having the microwave"** (More natural flow).
    
- **"I didn't like group meetings and I found that I have a abnormal mindset"** changed to **"I didn't enjoy the group meeting, and I realized I might have a somewhat unhelpful mindset"** (Improved wording; "abnormal" changed to "unhelpful").
    
- **"I even added some my personal negative thoughts to professors and exert back on myself"** changed to **"I find myself adding my own negative personal thoughts to what I imagine the professors think, which then reflects negatively back onto myself"** (Clarified the difficult, internal thought process).
    
- **"This process is really bad for me"** changed to **"This process is genuinely damaging to my self-esteem"** (Used stronger, more specific phrasing).
    
- **"I found I can gradually deal with a lot of things alone. I am really doing well."** combined and polished to **"I realized that I'm becoming increasingly capable of handling things on my own, which is a great feeling. I'm truly doing well!"** (Emphasized the positive realization).
    
- **"Only when I use these technologies, I could found their power"** changed to **"It's only when I actively use these technologies that I truly grasp their power and capability"** (More precise and dynamic verb choice).
