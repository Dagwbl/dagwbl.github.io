I didn't get out of bed until 11:30 today. After waking up, I checked my messages and had my chat proxy (Gemini) reply to them for me. Breaking out of my usual personality like this made me feel a lot better. It also got me thinking about how my "Chinese-style" personality doesn't really work in my favor here—it makes me too easy to be pushed around, and I'm the one who ends up feeling miserable.

After getting up, I stuffed myself with pig’s trotters and cooked a pot of greens 🥬. Then, I spent the rest of the day scrolling on my phone; my self-control is honestly non-existent. In the evening, I headed to the mall to pick up some nail clippers and toothpaste, as well as some fruit and vegetables.

Once I got back, I was right back on my phone and tablet again—thinking about studying while actually just playing around.

Tomorrow, I really should go to school or the library to study.

原文：

今天我 11 点半才起床，起床开始检查消息，叫我的代聊给我回复消息。这种突破自己的固有性格的方式使我舒服了很多，也开始反思自己中国式的性格最这里有点不大吃香了，老是容易被别人拿捏，自己还不舒服。

起床后干闷了猪脚，煮了一锅青菜🥬。然后又开始玩了一整天的手机，自控能力真的太低了。傍晚的时候去了趟商场买了指甲刀和牙膏，又去买了点水果和蔬菜。

回来又开始接着玩手机和平板了，一边想着学习一边玩。

明天还是去学校或者图书馆学习吧。
