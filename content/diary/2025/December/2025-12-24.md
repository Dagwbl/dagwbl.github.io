I spent ages fiddling with templates again today. For some reason, my previous template suddenly stopped working on my iPad—it’s honestly getting a bit annoying.

I didn’t sleep well, so I’ve been feeling under the weather all day. I planned to go to bed early, but somehow, I missed the chance again.

I barely got any studying done today. The noise in the room kept distracting me, and I’ve realized I’m becoming more and more sensitive to it. It’s a vicious cycle. I need to learn how to be at peace with my surroundings, focus on my inner self, and reclaim my attention.

I’ve come to realize I might be cut out to be a chef. Whenever I have free time, I love cooking a huge amount of food, but then I don’t even eat it—I just stockpile it. It’s a bad habit, as it usually ends up being not-so-fresh frozen leftovers.

Better luck tomorrow. Keep going!
