I still got up pretty late today, but at least I studied more than I did yesterday.

For lunch I had porridge and stir‑fried edamame with pork. For dinner I had instant noodles and some shredded pancake.

I watched a video today. I’ve always agreed with its main message, but seeing it again still served as a reminder.

Coming from a poor family, having the chance to study like this isn’t easy. I should cherish it, work hard, and not waste the opportunity.

My roommate came back today.

My roommate informed me to compute December and January bill. I said ok, and then he used his phone to send me the screenshot of result. I thought he said he would go to his classmate's room for caring a cat, so he shouldn't pay the electronic fee this month. Therefore, I asked him to get the bills.

I found he compute September twice and pointed this, but he didn't apologize to me. I think he should do that, if I were him.
