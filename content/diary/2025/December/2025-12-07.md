I **didn't sleep well again** last night. When I finally woke up at 10:30 AM, Huan was still asleep.

It was a **boring day**. I boiled some **rice noodles** for lunch, but I **didn't have much of an appetite** due to having eaten so much at yesterday's buffet.

In the afternoon, I focused on working on **Huan's visa application**. I honestly think her colleagues are completely **selfish**. They don't care about your actual needs; they only care about things that might affect **their own work or future**. So, all they say is, "We can only give you this." But is that what you actually need? **I really dislike their attitude.**

While I was doing my **laundry**, Alex messaged me to ask about my current **studies and life**. Our relationship seems to be **growing closer**.

I also want to make sure I **write an email to Mr. Rob to express my appreciation**.
