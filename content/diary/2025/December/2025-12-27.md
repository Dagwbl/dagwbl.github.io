I didn’t write my diary yesterday, so I’m making it up today.

What did I even do on December 27th? I’ve already forgotten and need to think carefully to recall it.

I got up very late, cooked some rice, and made a simple stir‑fry for lunch. After eating, I decided to go to the mall to buy a nail clipper and a box of toothpaste.

I saw KZ’s Moments post, so I went to Rogers to switch my SIM card to a 5G one. But my phone doesn’t support the mainstream 5G bands, so the network speed didn’t really improve.

Then I went to check out a church, but it was closed, so I decided to head to the EPL library instead for study.

It seemed like the snow‑clearing workers had also gone home for the holidays, because the snow on the road was ridiculously thick. By the time I was almost there, I felt like my face had frozen. I gave up and just went home.
