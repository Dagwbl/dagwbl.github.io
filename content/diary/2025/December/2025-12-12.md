Daytime was normal time. We had a coffee time in the afternoon.

Kourush played a piano music 🎹 for us, and Amir sang two songs for us. Chat leaded us to play the cheating game. It's very nice.

After then, Amir invited me to go shopping. I preferred to go T&T, but he thought the price is too high, so we walked over to Walmart under very cold snow. My tummy was not feeling good, and I didn't know what's reason. I bought some instant meal in T&T.

It's not a good idea to go shopping in winter in Edmonton.
