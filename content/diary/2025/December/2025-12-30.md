I spent the whole day binge-watching *Ted Lasso*.

In the afternoon, I decided to wash my bedsheets and small blanket to freshen them up and get rid of the dust. The **dry weather in Edmonton** makes everything get dusty so quickly!

However, the washing machine was completely useless with my small blanket. When the cycle finished, it was still **sopping wet**. I naively thought the dryer might still be able to handle it, even in that state.

Instead, the wet blanket ended up **cleaning the inside of the dryer** rather than getting dry. Eventually, I had no choice but to take everything out, **wash them by hand**, and wring them out myself. I’m planning to let them air-dry overnight before trying the dryer again tomorrow.

What bad luck—and I’m out **six dollars** in laundry fees!

I helped Huan register for a Mastodon account **this evening**. I don’t know why she had **so much trouble** doing it before.
