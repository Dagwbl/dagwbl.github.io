Today, Dr. Liu treated our group members to **Yangming buffet** to celebrate  the Christmas advance in winter season. Kourosh kindly **gave Amir and me a ride**. Although the weather was **very harsh**, I felt **incredibly warm** today. Everyone was so **kind and optimistic**.

During the buffet, Mr. Rob released the scores for **RFI #7 and the final exam**. I was so **scared** that I **didn't dare to open Canvas** to check my total grade. To encourage me to check the result, Amir and I made a **bet** on who would be the "loser."

Fortunately, I **passed the exam and earned an A-**! And, since I won the bet, I also won a **pizza**! Mr. Rob often said he isn't a kind person, but he truly is.
