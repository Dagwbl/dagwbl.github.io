I **didn't sleep well** last night and felt very **down**. Today was equally **difficult**.

We had our **last class at noon**, where we had to give our **final presentation**. At the end of the presentation, Dr. Mohammad asked us a question, but **I was unable to answer it**. I felt immediately **sad and ashamed**.

Ultimately, Dr. Mohammad gave us a score of **13/15**. He is a very **kind person**, but in that moment, I felt like I had **disappointed him**.

These last two days have been genuinely tough. I feel like I have **many shortcomings** and **a lot of studying** that I need to do.
