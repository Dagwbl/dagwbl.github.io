## 07 World and Money

It seems that dealing with people is a worldly thing. In my current cognition, secular is equal to money.

Including the seemingly fantasy things, including feng shui, god ghosts, etc., in the eyes of many people can profoundly affect personal or family destiny, they can be solved through secular means.

It seems that the world is the sea of ​​life, and we are fish that live in it.Any fish living in the water cannot survive from the world.Tracing back to the birth of the currency, what we can't do without it is a variety of currency equivalent, that is, a variety of products, because we personally cannot produce the necessities of our own life.

Unless, we change our lifestyle, change our life concepts, and personally cultivate, hunt, build houses, and weaves. Of course, some people really explore such a lifestyle in contemporary contemporary.This is not difficult, but it is not simple. It depends on the land where they are located. There are enough water, soil, salt and other necessities.

But do we need to pursue such a lifestyle so extreme?It should be: Is the worldly thing bad?Answer this question depends on our status and we have wealth. If we are the poor who are still worried about three meals a day, then the worldly is not good, and it has even become a source of trouble for our lives.Words such as integrated calculations, comparison of baht must compare, open source throttling, hard work, hard work, poor love and rich, etc., constitute the normal state of our lives. Regardless of whether it is denied or not, most people will be more cautious and impulsive when they involve more money.Money has also become the standard of most things in the world, including most people.

Recently, I heard that there are too many words on both sides. The world is an excellent manifestation of both sides.On the one hand, the world makes our society more social, and each individual is connected to each other, becoming a community of human destiny; on the other hand, it binds everyone in it, each connected tag online tags on the line onlineThere is no difference to everyone.It can be said that as long as we still live in this social collective, we cannot remove and strip this effect.

However, our attitude towards these labels is something we can choose.For yourself, "knowing the world but not the world" is a very high quality. For others, "knowing the world and the world" is also very high.We respect and understand others, so that we establish a good social relationship with others, whether it is worldly.Because the result is that we have avoided many impacts from society and will feel the benefits of society from time to time.

In general, we are not only inseparable from the world. On the contrary, we have to get some benefits from it.Echoing and beginning, naturally this is also the reason for our local pursuit of some money.

The gentleman loves the fortune, and it has a way.This road requires us to find it ourselves.But one direction is clear. Fortune comes from its own value, and its own value comes from the value of its own use.In other words, we must be able to provide the services needed by this society.
