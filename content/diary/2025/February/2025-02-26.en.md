This morning, I went to the office to finish my work and took the afternoon off to come back home.

Currently, I'm facing difficulties with my CSC application, and I blame myself for not having researched these matters thoroughly beforehand. However, after searching online, I found out that some provinces might not require social security contributions. I plan to call each province tomorrow to inquire about this.

You must give your all on every path you take to avoid leaving any regrets behind.
