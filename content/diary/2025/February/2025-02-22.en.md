On Saturday, Xiao Huanhuan and I took a whole day off.

It was a comfortably lazy day.

In the evening, we went out for a walk to see if we could buy some silver carp, and also to pick up a plug cord to see if we could get my electric wok working.

At the Minghu Market, we bought a cord that looked quite similar for 5 yuan, but it still didn't work—it wouldn't plug in, as if there were no standard specifications.

We didn't manage to buy any silver carp either, but we caught wind of the price (15 yuan per jin), which was quite a good deal compared to buying online.

At the aquatic products store, we saw a yellow catfish dancing gracefully in the tank, incredibly lively. The beauty of life was on full display at that moment, even if it was just under the light at the top of the tank.

How I wish to have a pond or a water jar, to bring it home with me.
