### 09:20 Optimizing Diary Information Display  

Yesterday, I only added the attributes but didn’t have time to implement them. Today, I spent some time making it work and also optimized the style and layout.  

### 09:52 Drew Number 27 for the Interview  

For the interview at the Energy Bureau, I drew number 27. Being at the very end is quite annoying.  

### 10:13 Studying After a Shower  

On the Himalaya App, there’s a program called [*National Centre for the Performing Arts | Listening to Classical Music*](https://m.ximalaya.com/album/2801256?from=pc). The host prepares each episode exceptionally well, even expanding on some stories and knowledge. It’s much better than randomly listening to songs or radio programs—no weird lyrics to make me feel agitated. It also allows me to appreciate the variations in music, preventing me from getting tired of the same genre too quickly.  

### 19:45 Repairing an Old Phone  

I managed to fix the broken phone at home earlier, but the back cover was still damaged. So, I bought a replacement online.  

It’s been quite a saga—I initially bought the wrong model and had to exchange it, and it just arrived today. After carefully cleaning off the residual adhesive and attaching the new back cover, I noticed it didn’t fit perfectly. I lightly tapped the edges that were sticking up, and... the newly replaced back cover shattered. Ugh. I ended up covering the broken part with a sticker to prevent glass shards from falling out.  

### 21:36 Reflecting on Today  

This afternoon, I tested whether the interview setup was working properly. After finishing the test, I went to the supermarket to buy groceries.  

Every time I go to the supermarket, I end up buying way too much food. Tonight, I planned to eat glass noodles, so I bought some. Huanhuan mentioned they had fish for lunch, so I bought a fish too. When I got home, I realized there was still some sliced cured meat from the day before yesterday that needed to be cooked soon. As a result, I now have more food than I can finish.  

This seems to clash with my fasting day plan. Oh well, I’ll figure it out later.
