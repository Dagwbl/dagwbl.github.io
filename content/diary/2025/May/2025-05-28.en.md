This morning, I tried frying peanuts for the first time. At first, nothing seemed to change, but after frying them a few seconds longer, I scooped them out only to find they had all turned golden. They were slightly overdone but not burnt.  

> [!tip]+ Timing for Scooping Out Peanuts  
> When just 3-5 peanuts start turning golden, immediately turn off the heat, move the pan, and scoop them out. Any delay of a few seconds in these steps will result in overcooking.  

In the morning, I finished watching Wang Defeng's lecture on *The Great Learning*. In the afternoon, I watched *Mission: Impossible â€“ Fallout*.  

In the evening, I watched Wang Defeng's lecture on *The Platform Sutra*. Though I felt like I gained nothing, I came to understand the spiritual worlds of others and realized my own shallowness.
