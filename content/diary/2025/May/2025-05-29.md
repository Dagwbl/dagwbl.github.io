### 09:38 给手机升级系统

近两天在刷酷安发现小米 15 的系统有一次正式大版本升级，看到大家说流畅省电很多，自己也就很想试试。但是还是在正式版内测，自己没有名额，就折腾了个把小时，用替换法偷渡的方法刷上了。

我以前特别喜欢更新手机系统，更新各种应用，第一时间去体验各种功能。但我通过发现我的小米 10 被负优化后，谨慎了很多。看网上这个是个普遍性的问题，几乎各家手机厂商存在这个问题；软硬件不是同一家的如电脑这些似乎并不存在这个问题。

总的来说，需要适时的停止更新系统和系统应用。什么时候停止有以下两个判断方法：

1. 手机发布一年左右，手机的迭代机型即将发布前；
2. 系统更新日志不详细，变得笼统而敷衍时。

满足以上两点就需要停止更新了，能获得一个较好的长期使用体验。

### 16:36 买了暖心之语这个游戏

这里面的人大部分都特别温暖，不像其他一些平台。而且这种匿名只交流一次的感觉让人很有神秘的感觉，你对面似乎是似乎是来自于另外一个世界。

我尝试写了发了两个问题，都得到了比较温馨的回复，虽然往往答案都在自己心中。

> Life has no meaning but the one you choose to give it. On my side, I ask myself if my actions align with my values, and reevaluate either one of them if that is not the case. I think one must not forget where one came from, but not to the point where the past become a burden. Same for the future, it should be an exciting goal to tend to but it should not take over our enjoyment of the present moment. I hope you can navigate your life successfully :)

> J, You are not alone. Just because you don't have a job right now that does not mean your are alone nor have value. This time likely has another purpose for you right now. I myself do not have a job right now but try to use the time gaining wisdom through the interactions I make and study a new skill. I actually just did some Blender practice since I want to get into 3D modeling and been trying to make myself practice everyday so I can be good enough to add it to my resume.

> I am also unemployed at the moment and kinda lost to what I should do for the future. I am trying to see it as an opportunity to reevaluate my choices as I didn't find fulfillment nor meaning in the corporate world, There are so many possibilities, it can make the choice daunting. You can do all the research and preparation that you want, but I think in the end it is only after you make the leap that you will know whether it suits you. Mistakes and doubts are part of the journey. So don't be afraid to try and fail!

### 19:30 散步

出去散了散步回来，整整两天没有出门了。出门有一种出狱的感觉，一切都是新鲜的，豁然开朗。

自己一个人去吃了很想吃的那家烤洋芋，洋芋非常好吃，佐料非常多，简直就是买佐料送洋芋。买了一碗银耳汤，感觉不是很划算，下次可以自己带水哈哈。

### 22:10 又买了一个游戏——涂鸦冒险家：无限

在杉果上 10 块钱打折买的。这是一款2009年的老游戏，但是画风和音乐都特别吸引人。使人很放松和开心，还可以在一定程度上学习几个单词，很棒。
