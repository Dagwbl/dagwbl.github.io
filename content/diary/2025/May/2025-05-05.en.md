Today is already the last day of the holiday—time really flies.

I slept in today, and after waking up, we continued playing games. I was hoping to finish the game today.  

Around 10 a.m., my brother called and asked me to drive to Liupanshui South Station to pick up Mom. When I met up with him, he said he had already arranged a ride-hailing service for her. We just happened to run into my brother, and then he left. We took the opportunity to have breakfast at Panxian Flavors.  

Huanhuan seemed a bit reluctant to let my brother know we had been together these past few days, feeling somewhat shy. I think if it were me, I’d feel the same way, but there isn’t really a good solution for it.  

By 2 p.m., we finally finished *It Takes Two*. It really is an amazing game.  

After resting for a few minutes, I took Huanhuan to the bus station. Just as we arrived, a driver from Panzhou approached us, so we avoided having to wait in line for the coach.  

When I got back, I originally planned to rest, but I ended up tinkering with Shizuku, Dizuku, and NFC cards on my phone. As a result, I didn’t get proper rest when I should have.  

There were still some leftover vegetables from yesterday, so I cooked noodles with them again today. Simple but delicious.  

After eating, I caught up on the diary entries I missed.  

Now it’s time to get back to work and give it my all.
