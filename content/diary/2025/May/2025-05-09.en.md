### 10:25 Xiaomi 15 Speaker Distortion  

I stayed up very late last night. While washing up, I noticed a thin layer of water stains on the counter where I placed the basin. I propped up my Xiaomi 15 against the basin to make a video call. Then I saw the water stains seeping into the phone through the case, so I quickly grabbed it, shook it off, and moved it elsewhere.  

A while later, I noticed the speaker was distorting—oddly, it was the top speaker. Ever since I got this phone, I’d felt the top speaker’s sound quality was subpar, but I never expected it to start distorting outright. I began searching forums and communities for similar issues and found that this wasn’t an isolated case. The speakers clearly have a problem. Strangely, water stains entering the charging port or audio jack could actually affect the distortion in the other speaker. Later, I used a hairdryer to blow air into the bottom speaker grille for a while, and the distortion improved somewhat.  

Though this is a minor issue, given the phone’s price, I don’t think such problems should exist. It made me consider returning or exchanging it. I kept browsing the community for possible solutions and before I knew it, it was already 2 a.m.
