This morning, I made lobster tail pasta, and it turned out pretty good. It’s just not as tasty as live crayfish, but it’s fine to have occasionally.  

After a short nap in the afternoon, we went to the seafood street and bought some oysters (¥3 each, opened on the spot) and clams (¥7 per pound—the vendor even threw out the bad ones). It was quite a good deal. Then we headed to the supermarket to pick up some side ingredients and seasonings.  

It was my first time cooking oysters myself, and they turned out incredibly delicious—especially the quality, which was completely different from the ones at barbecue restaurants. Last week, we had oysters at a restaurant, but they were very fishy and not tasty at all. The ones we made today were exceptionally fresh and sweet, truly delightful. The only downside was that the garlic wasn’t stir-fried beforehand, so the raw spiciness was a bit overpowering.  

We couldn’t finish all the clams, so we saved them for tomorrow.
