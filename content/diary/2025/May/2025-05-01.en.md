Today was a scorching sunny day, and I'm exhausted.  

The loquat tree next to the livestock pen at home had its bark completely gnawed off by the cow that was tied to it. Though the tree bore many loquats, the leaves had almost entirely withered, making it impossible for the fruit to ripen.  

This morning, I asked my parents to help me cut down the loquat tree. With little experience in tree-cutting, we encountered several dangerous moments during the process. One commendable thing was that my dad had the foresight to tie a rope around himself and the tree for safety. After much chaotic discussion, fumbling, and a few risky moments, we successfully felled the loquat tree.  

We used a chainsaw to cut the branches and trunk into smaller pieces and stacked them in the yard. The massive trunk was also sectioned into several parts to be used for making stools later.  

After cleaning up, we moved the chicken coop and pigeon cage that were originally under the loquat tree. It took us two to three hours to expand the flower bed, which now serves both as a fence and adds aesthetic appeal. By the next time I come home, the newly expanded flower bed should be even more vibrant.  

In the evening, after my dad took a shower, he noticed the showerhead was leaking. He tried to fix it with a wrench but ended up breaking it completely, earning him a long scolding from my mom. I often do the same thingâ€”trying to help but making things worse. My dad decided to go into town to buy a replacement. We asked him to pick up some beef while he was out, and in the evening, he stir-fried it into a dry pot beef dish, which turned out pretty tasty.

I did too much physical labor today, got extremely hungry, and ended up overeating.
