Getting up with a spring helps me wake up faster. After getting up, I called my mom and said I’d go see her to buy groceries, check on how she’s doing, and offer some encouragement.

The produce there is quite fresh, mostly grown by the sellers themselves. I bought some blueberries for my mom, and for myself, I picked up some greens, tofu, bamboo shoots, and tomatoes. I’ve got more vegetables than I can finish.

Running into things I don’t quite understand always leaves me feeling a bit frustrated, but I just let it be. Time flies—it’s already been a week into May, and the results of the CSC application will be out soon. Lately, people keep asking me about the outcome, but I don’t really want to dwell on it. Whether I pass or fail, it’ll bring its own set of troubles.

My mom has been wanting to learn how to take the bus. In the evening, I called and asked if she’d like to come out so I could teach her. She agreed. I showed her how to read the bus stop signs and demonstrated how to use the map on her phone. Finally, we took Bus No. 3 to the Maternal and Child Health Hospital, got off, and walked to People’s Square. There, we saw a group learning to dance, so I took her over to watch. She seemed curious but kept saying to herself that she was too clumsy and not flexible enough. I told her everyone starts learning at this age. After standing there for a while, she began mimicking the steps. I encouraged her to join in, and to my surprise, she really let loose and started dancing.

But the lesson was almost over, and soon the real music started for the group to dance along. She danced for a bit before coming back to me, saying she couldn’t keep up. I told her to just go and dance freely. After a while, she came back again, and I said, "Just keep dancing randomly for a few months, and you’ll pick it up."

Then I asked her to navigate us to the Telecom Building to take Bus No. 4 back. She still struggles to grasp the methods and logic behind it—her lack of spatial awareness is a big hurdle.
