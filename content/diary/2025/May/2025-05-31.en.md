Today, we planned to go to Huanhuan's maternal grandmother's house. She had been inviting us to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival in Chengguan for a while.  

Huanhuan's father went ahead first, while we took our time at home before heading over. We also carried a bag of rice that Huanhuan had received from her workplace.  

The second aunt was there too and prepared a big table full of delicious dishes for us. We went out to buy some fruit—lychees were particularly expensive at 10 yuan per pound, but they didn’t taste very good. We’ll have to buy fewer next time. We also bought a pineapple (I’ve always thought it was just another name for the same fruit). The vendor’s "Dubai knife skills" turned a whole large pineapple into just a tiny box of fruit. It might have been better to peel the pineapple ourselves during the family gathering—that way, we could have avoided sitting around with nothing to do but play on our phones.  

After finishing the meal, we headed back. In the evening, we met up with Xiaoxue and had some barbecue. I ended up eating way too much and felt uncomfortably full afterward.
