Summer has arrived, and I've been waking up quite early in the mornings, unable to fall back asleep, which feels a bit uncomfortable.  

After studying briefly in the morning, I felt drowsy again.  

Tomorrow, Xiaoyi has an interview with the Emergency Management Bureau, so he came to stay at Niuwa's place tonight. We had a meal together and went to find Deng Ya and the others.  

In the evening, Huanhuan's house was filled with relatives. I called and messaged her, but she didnâ€™t respond promptly. I knew she was once again facing pressure from all those relatives, and there was nothing I could do about it.  

Today seems to have passed in a daze.
