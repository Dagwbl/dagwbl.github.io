## Life

Last week was a busy week,  and I found that I couldn't fall asleep well. I got insomnia last Thursday.

It was a strength that the more I wanted to fall asleep, the more I couldn't sleep, especially when I forced myself to sleep. 

I told Amir this was the same reason for learning English; the more I wanted to learn English well, the more I couldn't.

The critical key is enjoying, decreasing the expectation, I think I will get better.

## Study

I have been absent from the group meeting for two weeks. Recently, I have still been focusing on the class. The assignments become more difficult over time, especially the Sensing Techniques and Data Analysis. Some knowledge previously learned I need to study again.

This week, I also have many things to do.
