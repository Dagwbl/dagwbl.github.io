这篇是后记录的。

鉴于每周都要开组会，每周都要汇报干了啥，且每次都找不到话说。还是在自己的博客上增加周记，提前做做准备也锻炼下自己。

This entry was written afterward.

Since I have group meetings every week and need to report what we have done each time, and I often find myself with nothing to say. So, I decided to start keeping weekly journal on my blog. 

It helps me prepare in advance and also serves as good practice.
