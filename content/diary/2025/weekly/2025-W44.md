# Life

Last week and weekend was better than the week before last week. I got better sleep, Although most of time it's through the help of melatonin, and now I've been trying sleep without melatonin. It's harmful for me if I relied it for a long term.

Last Saturday, Dr. Zhao and I went to Jollibee near the West Edmonton Mall to eat fried chicken. It's really good and satisfactory.
