### 23:48 关于学术

上上周因为周一放假，导致周例会推迟到周二，但是周二有课参加不了。

最近感觉都在忙于上课和写作业，作业总是会碰到各种各样的问题。我采矿的第一次作业，因为不熟悉系统，没有点击提交按钮，导致分数被扣了50%，非常伤心。这也使我变得更加后来更加谨慎。上周发现传感器技术的项目数据存在一些问题，和老师沟通了两天后老师发布了新的数据。这些问题也使我卡了很久。

这周完成了一个采矿作业，项目的进度也有所推进，接下来几天会更加忙碌

对了，我参加了一个培训项目，需要每周去上课两小时，主要侧重于提升学术能力和表达能力，我想我还是挺需要的。


### 23:56 关于生活

每天都感觉很累，感觉能量有点不够用的样子。上周五去参加了一个新生和老生的mixer，人非常多，是我会害怕的场面。会上有一个游戏，bingo，我会得到一张卡片，卡片上写着一些特征，我需要找到这些特征的人给我签名。我一开始并不敢去和别人打交道，矗立了一会儿，有人过来找我，我内心害怕又激动。这改变了我，我想我应该鼓起勇气去完成这个bingo卡片，况且可能还有奖励 🎉。

最终，我顺利的和大约20人打了招呼，并成功得到了他们的签名，内心的恐惧有好了一些。我想任何一点点的改变都是非常重要的，感谢Amir带我经常去融入各种我自己一个人不会融入的场合。

### 23:48 About Academics

Two weeks ago, because Monday was a holiday, our weekly meeting was postponed to Tuesday — but I couldn’t attend since I had class that day.

Lately, I’ve been busy with lectures and assignments, and I keep running into all sorts of problems with my coursework. For my first mining assignment, I wasn’t familiar with the submission system and forgot to click the “Submit” button, which cost me 50% of my grade — it was really discouraging. But it also made me more cautious afterwards.

Last week, I found some issues with the data for the sensor technology project. After two days of communicating with the instructor, the professor released a new dataset. These issues delayed my progress quite a bit.

This week, I finished a mining assignment, and my project has also made some progress. The next few days will be even busier.

Oh, and I joined a training program that requires two hours of class each week. It mainly focuses on improving academic and communication skills — something I really feel I need.

### 23:56 About Life

I’ve been feeling tired every day lately, like I don’t have enough energy. Last Friday, I went to a mixer event for new and returning students. There were a lot of people — the kind of setting that usually makes me anxious.

They had a game called *Bingo*. I received a card with different traits written on it, and I had to find people who matched those traits and get their signatures. At first, I was too nervous to approach anyone and just stood there awkwardly. Then someone came up to me — I felt scared but also excited. That moment changed me. I thought, “I should be brave and try to complete this bingo card — plus, there might even be a prize 🎉.”

In the end, I managed to talk to about 20 people and collected all their signatures. The fear inside me eased a little. I realized that even the smallest changes matter. I’m really thankful to Amir, who often encourages me to join activities I wouldn’t go to on my own.
