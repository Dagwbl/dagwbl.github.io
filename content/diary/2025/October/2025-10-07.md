今天干了啥了？这是来自后一天的回想。

对了，早上等 Fido 来打电话。他们一直在尝试从我的银行卡里面扣钱，好在最后他们说给我把扣款方式删除了，应该不会再尝试扣我的钱了。Bell 里的那个中国人也是有点过于自信，也谈不上特别好，还是不要带有情怀滤镜为好。

到学校已经十点过一些，比较晚了。直接去了 CatLab 学习 Deswik，然后就是上课，再然后就是困，直到开始整理自己学习记录，开始梳理完善工作流畅，才开始进入心流的状态。

梳理完毕后，开始着手写混泥土课的作业。不熟悉的领域是真的难受，写到晚上七点过，交了作业，九点过老师回复 AI 生成率过高，需要重新表述。

十点爬起来改到十二点，给老师发了邮件。也不知道可以不可以，就这样吧。

What did I do today?  This is a recollection from the following day.

Right, in the morning, I waited for Fido to call. They had been charging money from my bank card, but fortunately, they said they would delete the payment method, so they should not try to charge me more money. The Chinese woman is also a little overconfident — not particularly good, really. It's not to look at her through a sentimental filter.

I got to school a little after 10 am, which was pretty late. I went straight to CatLab to study Deswik, then went to class, and then felt sleepy. Until I started organizing my study notes and refining my workflow. That's when I finally entered a flow state.

After finishing that, I began working on my concrete assignment. It's really tough dealing with an unfamiliar field.

I worked on it until after 7 pm, submitted it, and around 9 pm Mr. Robert replied, saying the AI-generated rate was too high and I needed to revise it.

I got up at 10 pm, revised until midnight, and sent the email to Robert.

No idea if it will be accepted — but oh well, that's that.
