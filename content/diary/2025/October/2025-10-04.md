### 10:36 Received ¥150 from Xue

Huan told Xue that today is my birthday, and I jokingly asked Xue to give me some money. In the end, Xue actually transferred ¥150 to me. I felt very happy—and Huan was even happier than I was.

I boiled some dumplings for breakfast. Not bad!

### Afternoon

On the afternoon, I walked at river valley with Amir. The autumn is very beautiful, but it's so cold today.

Nice day!
