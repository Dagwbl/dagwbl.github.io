### 00:21 Good Night

Go to bed.

### 10:45 improve the add note script
I probably won't update it anymore, it's very useful.

### 15:30 get some free pizza
During the class break, I and Amir went to triffo hall to get some pizza. Because we heard that there will be a lecture today, and there will be free pizza.

Indeed, we got some pizza there, but we backed the class late. In addition, We made some disturb to the lecture. 

So, I was regret for this and I think I won't do that anymore.

### 16:11 Profile config

```shell
# ? $Profile ??????

function now {
	& "D:\A\Jeapo's blog\assets\code\now.ps1"
	clear
}

# ===== ??????? =====
Set-Alias -Name n -Value now
```
