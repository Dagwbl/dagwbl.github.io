### 15:21 Bought two long-sleeve shirts

Why is the quality of these clothes so bad? I don't know

### 15:41 Feel sleepy

I don't know why I'm so sleepy.

### 20:06 Smelly lamb meat

I bought a lamb leg on Saturday and I boiled it yesterday.

The lamb of Canada is so smelly. I became a fat lamb after eating.

### 20:08 Weekly journal

I added the weekly journal function on my blog so that I can prepare the notes for the group meeting on Monday. I hope I can keep it as a good habit.
