### 12:47 Have lunch

I felt that my speaking and listening ability decreased. 


### 12:49 Janice

Janice is a cross-platform opensource software especially to view and simplly handle the json file. It's perfect to help me solved the big json file problem.


### 18:15 Get off work

Today is a focus day.

### 20:59 Eat dumplings

Recently, I became busier than before. I am already lazy for cooking.

Prepare to do some assignments after eating dumplings.

### 21:34 Improve PowerShell profile

```shell
# Record now
function now {
    param(
        [switch]$t,
        [string]$TyporaPath
    )
    & "D:\blog\assets\code\now.ps1" @PSBoundParameters
}

function push {
    param(
        [string]$Message = ""
    )
    
    # ���û���ṩ��Ϣ��ʹ�õ�ǰ����ʱ��
    if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($Message)) {
        $date = Get-Date -Format "MMMM d, yyyy"
        $time = Get-Date -Format "HH:mm"
        $Message = "diary: $date $time"
    }
    
    Write-Host "Adding all changes..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
    git add .
    
    Write-Host "Committing with message: $Message" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    git commit -m $Message
    
    Write-Host "Pushing to remote..." -ForegroundColor Green
    git push
    
    Write-Host "Done!" -ForegroundColor Green
}

Set-Alias -Name n -Value now
```

Now can directly call Typora to edit diary so that can get Grammarly support.
