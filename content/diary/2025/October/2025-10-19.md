### 16:16 Exhausted

I just want to sleep all day, but I can't fall asleep.


### 16:31 Detroit: become human

I bought a game from Steam, and I heard that it is very amusing.


### 22:44 Watch *K-POP: Demon Hunter*

At first, I didn't like this movie, especially the type and the style. But I found that the cover I saw knew its songs very popular. After watching, it's really a nice movie.


### 22:48 Watch *How to Train Dragons: The Hidden World*

A nice movie, it made me calm down and feel relaxed. 

And I found that I can understand a movie without Chinese; I am getting more and more familiar with English.

The information from cellphones always makes me feel dizzy and eye-hurt.


### 22:51 Bitter gourd stewed pork ribs

Not bad, I cooked it while watching movies, for tomorrow's lunch.

And I had a KFC with a nice offer, and bought some groceries from Safeway.

We feel happy if our tummy is satisfied.

### 22:43 Take a shower

Felt more awake
