My roommate decided to **cut his own hair**, but he **failed spectacularly**. He ended up knocking on my door and asking me to **take a look at the damage**. It was hilarious! In Chinese, we'd say his haircut looked like it had been **"eaten by a dog."**

I bought a **secondhand microwave** last night, and the seller dropped it off at the Southgate station this afternoon. The microwave was **so heavy** that I was **sweating** by the time I got it home.

After finally putting the microwave away, I headed back out to **buy some groceries**. I bought a lot of items, including **tomatoes, lettuce, pork**, and more.
