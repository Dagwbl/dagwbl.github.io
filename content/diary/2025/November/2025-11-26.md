Today was worn out because I did the RFI 6 from 10 am to next day am.

I didn't sleep well last night, so I bought a coffee at Tim Hortons when I came school.

Amir and I wanted to go swimming, however the east pool was not available for public, at the same time, the west pool was very crowded.

We already changed our trunks and took a shower, we only could change back and leave.

Since we separated, amir was very happy and went to the karaoke.

When I got home, I found my cactus was freezing though I put it inside my room and next to the opened window.
