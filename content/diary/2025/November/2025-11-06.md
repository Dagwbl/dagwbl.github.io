### 09:39 Begin

I was attending a mindfulness workshop.

It's snow today, Amir and I were very happy, we took some photos.

### 13:25 Thank Chat

In the noon, a guy said his friend taught him a Chinese sentence, and asked me wheather know about it.

But that sentence was a dirty and rude one. I told back: fuck you!

Later, I told this thing to my friends, just right the guy came across. Chatrangha called the guy and scold him, and the guy immidiately apologized to me.

### 16:50 Go to the Concrete class

The Concrete class was really tough, cold, tired, boring, hungry.
