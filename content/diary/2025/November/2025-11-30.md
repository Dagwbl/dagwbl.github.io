The **daytime is extremely short** in Edmonton during the winter!

I **woke up at 12 PM** and then cooked some food for lunch. After that, I took a shower and took some time to **relax**. By the time it was approaching **4 PM, the sun had already set** (or **the sun was gone**).

I spent some time studying my textbook, **_Writing Academic English_**. I recently discovered **Zotero** and found it to be a **very good tool for taking notes** and managing references. I plan to use it to **take tons of notes** going forward.

Later, I **cooked a lot of food** to prepare for the next few days.
