### 09:37 Arrive at office

It took about 40 minutes for commuting.


### 14:51 My phone fell into the toilet

One second before, I thought whether my phone on my leg would fall into the toilet and the next second it fell.


### 23:15 Write journal 

I found that Amir likes to hangout around especially at supermarket.

Tonight, he wanted buy a trunks, so I accompanied him to go to Walmart, but finally he didn't buy anything, and I bought a lot groceries.

In addition, ZJ told me that he thought we can have another roommate. It's crazy in my heart, however I only said I don't recommend to do that. Moreover we only have one bathroom.

He might be thinking that I'm kind and easy to get along with. Perhaps he didn't know all these are from inclusive roommate, or called tolerance.

### grammar check

The rest of your writing is grammatically correct and sounds natural. The main issues were:
- Some awkward phrasing that could be more natural
- A few missing articles ("the", "a")
- Some verb tense inconsistencies
- A few missing prepositions

Would you like me to explain any of these corrections in more detail?
