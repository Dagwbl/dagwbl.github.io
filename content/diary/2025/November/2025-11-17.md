## Sensitivity 

There was the group meeting today, and I don't like it due to my sensitivity. But it's useful to let me face my sensitivity and change it.

I always thought others will judge me for my ability or my behaviors. I knew that was not right, but I can't control it sometimes.

Amir gave me a great support, and I really appreciate him. I think I shouldn't always emit the negative aspect to others. I need to change my mind and be brave.

Don't assume or suspicious others will judge you first.

Here are notes summarizing the key points and phrases from the video "How to Give a Presentation - Business English."
### 1. Introducing Yourself and Your Topic

You need to establish who you are and what you are talking about immediately. Adjust your language based on the formality of the situation.
 * Introducing Yourself:
   * Formal: "Good morning everyone. For those who don't know me, my name is [Name] and I work in [Department]." or "Before we begin, let me introduce myself briefly. I'm [Name]..." [01:01]
   * Informal: "Hi guys, if you don't know me, I'm [Name]..." or "I see some new faces so I'll introduce myself first." [01:18]
 * Introducing the Topic:
   * Simple Topic: "Today I'm going to be talking about..." or "I'd like to talk to you today about..." [01:45]
   * Complex Topic (Roadmap): Break it down into stages. "I'll begin by outlining... and then I'll go on to highlight... Finally, I'll briefly discuss..." [02:10]
### 2. Engaging the Audience
Good speakers work hard to earn attention; bad speakers assume they already have it. Use these three techniques to hook your audience early on:
 * Establish a Problem & Solution: Connect a boring topic to the audience's pain points.
   * Example: "Have you ever felt unfairly treated at work? ... We've been working on new policies to ensure fair recognition." [05:22]
 * Mention a Surprising Fact or Statistic: Grab attention with data.
   * Example: "Did you know that the average office worker only does four hours of productive work a day?" [06:06]
 * Tell a Short Story: Stories add an emotional dimension.
   * Example: "I once met a young salesman..." [06:34]
### 3. Organizing Your Presentation (Signposting)
"Signposting" uses specific phrases to show the audience where you are in the presentation. It follows the rule: Tell them what you’re going to say, say it, then tell them what you said. [07:44]
 * Moving to the next point:
   * "Next I'd like to talk about..."
   * "Let's move on and discuss..."
   * "At this point, I'd like to turn to..." [10:28]
 * Adding detail:
   * "Let me go into some more detail about..."
   * "Let's examine [topic] in more depth." [10:54]
 * Concluding/wrapping up:
   * "To wrap up, let's remind ourselves..."
   * "Let's review the key points from this session." [11:04]
### 4. Dealing with Problems
Things often go wrong. Use these phrases to recover smoothly without panicking.
 * If you lose your place / forget a word:
   * "Where was I?"
   * "So, what was I saying?"
   * "What's the word in English again?" (Look at your cue cards instead of staying silent). [13:15]
 * If you make a mistake:
   * "Let me rephrase that."
   * "Actually, what I meant to say is..."
   * "To clarify, I wanted to say that..." [13:51]
 * If you forgot to mention something important:
   * "Let me just add one more thing."
   * "Let me return to an earlier point briefly." [14:15]
### 5. Handling Difficult Questions
Use the "Three D's" strategy when you can't (or don't want to) answer a question immediately.
 * Delay: Give yourself time to research or think.
   * "I've allocated time for questions at the end..."
   * "I'm not in a position to answer that right now, but I'll get back to you later." [14:52]
 * Deflect: Pass the question to someone else.
   * "That's an interesting question. Before I answer, I'd like to know what's your take on this?" [15:20]
 * Dismiss: If the question is irrelevant.
   * "Thanks for your input, but I don't see how that's connected to what I'm saying."
   * "I don't mean to be blunt, but I don't think that's relevant to today's discussion." [15:49]
