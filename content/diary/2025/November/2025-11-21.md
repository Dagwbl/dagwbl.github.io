> I almost forgot today's things.

I attended the Sensing techniques and Data Analytics at noon. and I used Quarto + Beamer to finish a Beamer slides. I like this things to release human productivity.

In the evening, I went to the apartment's swimming pool to learn swimming. I should be more brave.
