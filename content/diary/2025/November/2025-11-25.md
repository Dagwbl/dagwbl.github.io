### 09:53 Buy a coffee

I didn't sleep well last night, so I bought a coffee when I arrived at school this morning.

There was a mining class; I still have some unsatisfied emotions towards Mr. Sorush.



### 17:02 Go home

Amir wanted to go to a talk about Venture capital to snag some pizza. I didn't want to go; a part of the reason was my English, and another part of the reason was that I didn't want to stay at school too late, and it's not good if I left after eating some pizza.
