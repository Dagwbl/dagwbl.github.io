Just woke up, I picked up my phone and saw three voice messages from my sister. I clicked them and found that are blessing from my little niece. It's so cute and delightful.


I recorded the assignment video in the morning.

### 10:38 Arrive at Office

I continued to modify my presentation after arriving office.

Today's group meeting was not bad, and I first time to tell others *today is my birthday*. I think this is a change to me.

### 15:39 Go home

I spend two hours on recording again, it's boring and I felt my eyes painful. So I submitted it hastily. I felt better after that.

Oh, today I treated Amir for a personal pizza, for my birthday. It's not bad. And then I bought a box of eggs, some pork ribs and a box of blueberries. I need to eat more vege and fruit.
