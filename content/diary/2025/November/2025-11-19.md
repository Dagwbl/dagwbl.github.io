To Soroush
> I think it's essential to allow students to make mistakes and show sympathy. Whatever for teachers or students, the ultimate goal is not grading or marking, but patiently guiding and leading us with truth and purpose. 
> Don't ignore any information from students. As a teacher, you should give your feedback to students, whether rejection or affirmation, and give your reason; rather than ignoring.
