### 11:08 SPOT

To Soroush
> I think it's essential to allow students to make mistakes and show sympathy. Whatever for teachers or students, the ultimate goal is not grading or marking, but patiently guiding and leading us with truth and purpose. 
> Don't ignore any information from students. As a teacher, you should give your feedback to students, whether rejection or affirmation, and give your reason; rather than ignoring.

### Write Assignment 5

The teacher is not good.

### Create Quarto Template

1. Don't use a blank line in math mode in Quarto
2. pdflatex can not deal with the Unicode symbol
3. Too much trouble when using latex
4. `align` in `$$` will report an error, but `aligned` doesn't.



### Typst

It seems a better choice for writing, and it can excellently cooperate with Quarto.

### Complete the Engg template with copilot

The copilot in Github is very strong and useful! Amazing!
