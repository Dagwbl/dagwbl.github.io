This week is reading week, which means it doesn't have any classes.

I got up early and cooked some pasta for lunch because I didn't cook last night.

I arrived at the office about 09:48, and got off work at nearly 5.

I accompanied Amir to buy his trunks, but there isn't any shop selling it. Damnit.

I should be used to write diary on my phone. Turning on my laptop is a thing which is full of obstacles.

And I need to write more words to practice my writing.

> Practice makes perfect!
