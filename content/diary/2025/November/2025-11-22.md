Three days ago, Amir and I signed up an activity about a trip. It required us getting up very early, and we need assemble at university on 6:30 am.

Today's journey was taking bus for three and an half hours, and then spent two hours on Royal Terrel Museum for dinosaur fossils, and then spent ten minutes to take a picture at Horsethief Canyon. It's a little boring.

I was very tired in the evening.

Meanwhile I was very happy, because I dug a cactus at Badland, but this is a big challenge for me to take care a cactus in Edmonton.
