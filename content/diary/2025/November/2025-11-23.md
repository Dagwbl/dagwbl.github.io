### 18:59 Adjust the fontsize in Beamer

It's hard to adjust fontsize in beamer, especially using Quarto as  the writer.

````latex
```{=latex}

\begingroup

\fontsize{6}{8}\selectfont

\color{red}

```


Target content


```{=latex}

\endgroup

```
````
I found we can easily to control the style on some specific content. It was defined at [Authoring > Markdown Basics > Raw Content](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html%23raw-content) This method can disable `raw_text` to avoid output the command, refer to [Pandoc - Pandoc User’s Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#raw-htmltex)
```latex
\tiny{}
Target content
```

Furthermore, I still can create some `\newcommand` at `header-includes` or `preamble.tex`, and then I can use the new command in whole document. It was defined at [Reference > Formats > PDF > Includes](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/pdf.html%23includes)
