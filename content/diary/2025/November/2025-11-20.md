## I like coding

Thursdays are tiring days because I usually got insomnia on Wednesdays. The most critical thing is that there is the concrete class till 8 PM every Thursday, which is accompanied with hunger, tiring and boring.

Today I finished the assignment 5 of mining, and made a Tex template of Quarto for assignment. It's really useful for produce documents. I will keep learning Latex in the future.

## Grammar check 

Here's a grammar and clarity check for your diary entry:

| Original | Correct | Reason |
|----------|---------|--------|
| "Thursdays are tiring days because I usually got insomnia on Wednesdays." | "Thursdays are tiring because I usually get insomnia on Wednesdays." | "Got" should be present tense "get" to match "usually". "Tiring days" is redundant - just "tiring" is more natural. |
| "The most critical thing is that there is the concrete class till 8 PM every Thursday, which is accompanied with hunger, tiring and boring." | "The worst part is the concrete class that lasts until 8 PM every Thursday, which leaves me hungry, tired, and bored." | More natural phrasing. "Accompanied with" is incorrect preposition. "Tiring" should be "tired" (adjective form). |
| "Today I finished the assignment 5 of mining, and made a Tex template of Quarto for assignment." | "Today I finished Mining Assignment 5 and created a Quarto LaTeX template for assignments." | "Assignment 5 of mining" → more natural to put subject first. "Made a Tex template" → "created a LaTeX template" is more precise. |
| "It's really useful for produce documents." | "It's really useful for producing documents." | "For" should be followed by gerund (-ing form). |

The rest of your writing is grammatically correct and natural. The entry effectively communicates your Thursday experiences and productivity. The only remaining suggestions would be stylistic:
- Consider adding more specific details about your insomnia or the concrete class to make the entry more vivid
- You might want to expand on why Quarto/LaTeX is useful for your workflow
