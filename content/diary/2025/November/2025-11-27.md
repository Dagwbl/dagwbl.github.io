Today I have two classes. It's tiring Thursday again.

I almost made a mistake again today, the due date of assignment 5 is today's 12 pm. I thought it is the midnight of today. 

Fortunately, I submitted it about 11 am, and I even reminded amir don't forget to submit it at 12 pm. And then he told me about that.

I and amir originally decided to attend an event for pizza, but I didn't go because I felt very sleepy at that time.

Therefore, amir got sad and angry, but I also don't like others to force me to do some things. I preferred for choosing the way made me comfortable.

When we met each other again, he looked like enemy and said some bad words. It's a really good opportunity for us to know each other deeply.
