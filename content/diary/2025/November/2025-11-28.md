I love **Fridays**! It's not just because I get to have a relaxing next two days, but also because I truly **dislike Thursdays**.

Today, we had the **final lecture** with Mr. Mohammad. He was such a **nice person** and always **cared for his students**. I really admire him and **hope to become someone like him** one day.

We left school early today, and the **sunset was absolutely beautiful**—the clouds were so **warm and vibrant**.

I **went with Amir to Southgate** because he wanted to buy a phone for Black Friday.

Unfortunately, a staff member at the **Rogers store had a very bad attitude**. After we left the shop, Amir was so upset that he **muttered a few choice words**.

Finally, Amir wanted to stop at **Walmart to buy some groceries**, but I didn't want to go. I was **too tired** and all I wanted was to **lie down in my bed as soon as possible**.
