Today was my first time to go swimming formally. It's a little bad because I soaked too much water. As a new experience, however, it's definitely good.

Amir can swimming, but I can't; I need to learn it. Thank my little Huan delivered gaggles and trunks to me. It's really useful.

Dr.zhao retook graduation photos today, he was very happy, so many people said congratulations to him. The everyone of our group took a photo with him individually.
