After discussing with Mr. Hu, Mr. Liu, and my family, I decided to go to the office tomorrow to pick up my passport.  

I’m particularly nervous about dealing with work-related matters—all the procedures and approvals—but I have no choice but to face them.  

I reached out to former colleagues, mentors, and people involved in the relevant processes, chatting with them for a while. I’m also hoping to find time tomorrow to have a meal with them if possible.  

In the afternoon, the Emergency Management Bureau asked me to write a voluntary waiver statement and required me to sign it in person. Since I might not be in Shuicheng much longer, I didn’t want to delay their work, so I took a taxi to the bureau. Surprisingly, the people there didn’t blame me at all—instead, they expressed admiration and support. We chatted for a bit, and they even helped me print out some documents.  

On the way back, I called my mom, who invited me over for dinner. It had been a long time since I last ate her cooking, and it still had that familiar taste. It wasn’t necessarily gourmet-level, but it was comforting and made me feel warm inside.  

In the evening, I talked with Huanhuan until 1 a.m., so I hurried to bed—I need to wake up early tomorrow.
