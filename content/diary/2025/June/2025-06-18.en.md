Today was a blur—I spent three hours gaming with Fei Ge.  

In the morning, the Emergency Management Bureau called me to ask some questions, marking the beginning of the investigation phase.  

In the evening, I suddenly learned that my CSC application had been approved, which immediately triggered my anxiety.  

So I wrote a letter to my advisor explaining my worries: [letter_202506182210](../../../letter/letter_202506182210.md).  

What wasn’t mentioned in the letter was my reluctance to part with Huanhuan. Long-distance separation brings more pain to those in love, but it can also forge stronger support.
