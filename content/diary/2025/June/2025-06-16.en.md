I didn't do anything today.

Got up in the morning and cooked a big bowl of rice noodles. The noodles were bought yesterday, but since the weather is hot and they won’t keep for long, I decided to finish them all today. At noon, I cooked another big bowl and fried two eggs, ending up stuffed. I really should eat less in the future.

In the afternoon, I still didn’t do anything. I felt a bit anxious about the CSC results, the Emergency Management Bureau results, and the Gui'an results, so I checked them over and over again.

Later, I went out for a walk toward Baihe Park. I stopped by Mixue Ice Cream & Tea to buy a "Stir-Fresh Orange" drink, some lychees, a few fresh melons, and some dried tofu. Came back, made dinner, and ended up overeating again.

The fat on my face and body is visibly increasing—I need to consciously control it.

In the evening, I played a couple of games with Huanhuan.
