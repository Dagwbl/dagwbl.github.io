This morning, I received a call about the express delivery of my ID card. I thought it hadn’t started shipping yet, but unexpectedly, it had already arrived. I quickly washed my face in a hurry and went to pick it up. Now, a new issue has come up: when applying for a credit card, the system still requires identity verification, and the CSC system still has my old ID number.

After getting my ID card, I bought two meat pies and a portion of sticky rice. I rested for a while, and at noon, my brother called to invite us over for crayfish to celebrate Zhu Xiaoyu’s birthday. I got up, finished the leftover beef and shrimp from yesterday, took a shower, and then strolled over.

By the time I got back in the evening, it was already quite late. Happy times always fly by so quickly.
