I didn't plan well today. I was supposed to go to Chongqing today and get my fingerprints recorded tomorrow.  

But I kept procrastinating until the afternoon, and then it was too late. I'll go on Monday to get it done, and I might as well get the medical checkup done at the same time.  

In the afternoon, I played games with Brother Fei all day and lost every match. We were both confused yet somehow content.
