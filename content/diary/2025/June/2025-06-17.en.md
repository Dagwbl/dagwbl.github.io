### 14:04 Checking CSC  

Just saw someone on Xiaohongshu say that the results for the CSC (China Scholarship Council) program in the Americas region have been released. I nervously checked immediately, but nothing yet. I’m still quite anxious—worried about the Emergency Management Bureau’s upcoming inspection, concerned that the Gui’an announcement might drop soon and schedule a physical exam, and now also stressing over the CSC results.  

### 14:19 Can’t Stop Thinking About the War  

Ever since learning about the military actions between Iran and Israel, I can’t help but constantly refresh social media for updates during my free time. Maybe it’s a survival instinct, but as an individual, I can only be a bystander, which somehow deepens my anxiety.  

### 14:40 Persistent Anxiety  

The only outcome that could relieve my anxiety is if the CSC gives me a "not approved" result. Even if I pass, I’ll still face other difficulties and choices, keeping the anxiety alive.  

### 17:13 Played Games with Feige All Afternoon  

I couldn’t focus on tasks that required high concentration, so I ended up gaming with Feige for the entire afternoon.  

### 21:32 Went Out for a Walk in the Afternoon  

After dinner, I felt stifled indoors and went out for a stroll. Bought two carrots and four pounds of potatoes.  

### 21:59 Watched a Video

Learned about the concepts and distinctions between **signifier** and **signified**. I also agree with the teacher’s point that attitude is more of an ability—for example, humility isn’t just an attitude but an ability, and being perceptive isn’t an attitude but an ability.
