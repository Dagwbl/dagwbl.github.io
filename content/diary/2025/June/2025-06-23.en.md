This morning, I sent Huanhuan off to work. While hailing a taxi, I noticed the driver stopping by the roadside to buy a scallion pancake, so I got one too.

After reluctantly saying goodbye to Huanhuan, I hurried back to Shuicheng. Still feeling quite hungry upon returning, I quickly cooked some rice and stir-fried two dishes to eat.

It seems the mouse that had sneaked into the room earlier is no longer around.

In the afternoon, I started emailing Professor Liu and the staff at the University of Alberta's funding center and international center, asking why I hadnâ€™t received certain emails and where to obtain the provincial attestation letter (PAL), among other things.

In the evening, I received a reply and finally joined the official CSC newcomers' group. I then began preparing to fill out the visa application information on the IRCC website.
