### 09:40 Started Preparing Visa Application Materials  

Finished the Client Information in the morning and filled out all the required forms in the afternoon. Also, I found a translation company on Taobao to translate my ID card and no-criminal record certificate for 50 yuan.  

### 17:37 Materials Almost Ready  

My eyes feel a bit strained from staring at the computer for too long. Planning to cook dinner—golden beans and potatoes tonight—and also give Fei Ge a call.  

A lot of my fear and anxiety stem from unfamiliarity and lack of understanding. At first, I was really nervous about the visa process, worried it would be extremely difficult. But once I actually started preparing, I realized it wasn’t as hard as I imagined. Although I haven’t submitted it yet and don’t know whether it’ll be approved, the initial fear and anxiety have faded.  

### 20:20 Finally Submitted the Visa Application  

After carefully reviewing everything, I submitted the visa materials. Thankfully, Huanhuan helped me get a Visa credit card earlier, so the payment process went smoothly this time.  

### 22:22 Played Honor of Kings with Fei Ge for Over an Hour  

The matches are getting harder, and it’s easy to run into teammates with bad attitudes.
