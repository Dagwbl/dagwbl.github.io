Today was a particularly fun day.

I slept in this morning, and when I got up, Huanhuan's mom had cooked congee. I had three bowls and ended up stuffed.

At noon, Huanhuan's mom prepared a delicious lunch for us, and everything was very tasty. After eating, I played a few rounds of games with Fei Ge, then pulled out my laptop to prepare some materials. Around 1 PM, Huanhuan's dad went out for a walk, and we rested for a while.

Fengxian's baby was born this morning. A little after 2 PM, Huanhuan and I went to the office to work overtime. After finishing, we went to buy flowers for her. We saw the first flower shop with two bouquets placed outside, but they didn’t look very fresh. The owner asked for 128, but I bargained down to 88. Huanhuan quickly paid the money.

Just a minute after we left, we spotted another flower shop with much fresher flowers and managed to haggle the price down to 68. So, we decided to take a small loss and return the flowers to the first shop, not wanting the owner to lose out either. But the owner’s attitude turned extremely hostile, completely different from the friendly smile earlier. We argued with the owner and his wife for quite a while, but it didn’t work out.

At that moment, I really wanted to throw the flowers in the owner’s face, but I was afraid of scaring Huanhuan with such an outburst. After cursing a few times, we left and apologized to the owner of the other shop.

A light rain started to fall, and Huanhuan took me to see the unfinished apartment she’s planning to buy. It’s quite nice—once decorated, it should feel very cozy—though it seemed a bit pricey, but still acceptable.

Fengxian was in good spirits and even invited us to stay for dinner as we were leaving. We decided to go home and make fried rice with eggs instead.
