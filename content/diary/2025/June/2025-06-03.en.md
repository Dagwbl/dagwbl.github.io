Early this morning, I received a message from Professor Hu, which immediately got me anxious again. I quickly got up to check the progress of my CSC application, and sure enough, there was no update yet.  

My mom also called me early in the morning, asking if I was coming over to pick up some rice. I hadn’t even gotten out of bed yet.  

After getting up, I did laundry and took a shower. Then I lay in bed and finished reading *Animal Farm*—it was incredibly satirical and blunt. I bought the English original to keep at home, so I can read it again next time I’m back.  

In the afternoon, I played video games for nearly an hour, mostly out of boredom and anxiety. Later, I went to see my mom. She gave me some meat and a few ears of corn. On my way back, I bought some waxberries and peaches, then stopped by the supermarket to pick up groceries. That should last me about a week.  

I’m a bit worried that I might not pass the pre-employment physical exam, so I scheduled a check-up for tomorrow to see how things look first. The free health check-up from JD.com finally came in handy.  

Today’s fried peanuts turned out perfectly—the heat control was just right. As soon as I smelled the aroma, I knew it was time to turn off the stove.
