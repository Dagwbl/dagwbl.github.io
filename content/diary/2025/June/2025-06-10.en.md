It might have been the unclean food I ate yesterday, but I woke up this morning feeling dizzy and groggy. Taking a shower didn’t help, and my stool was a bit loose too.

I just lay in bed until noon, not even wanting to eat. By the afternoon, I felt so unwell that I forced myself to go out for a walk, though I was completely drained of energy. Passing by a rice cake shop, I noticed hundreds of stacked steamers inside and thought the cakes must be good. I bought one, broke off a piece, and it turned out to be quite tasty.

On the way back, I figured not eating wasn’t a solution, so I decided to have something easy to digest. I ordered a bowl of rice noodles, which wasn’t particularly delicious, but I managed to finish it with some garlic.

In the evening, I thought I should distract myself, so I played *Honor of Kings* for a while. The game is pretty boring, but at least I could play it lying down.
