### 02:07 Insomnia Again  

Lately, I’ve been struggling with insomnia—thinking about my visa, about Xiaohuanhuan, about family, about friends. I just can’t seem to control my mind.  

### 02:35 Got Up to Cook Instant Noodles  

Couldn’t sleep at all, so I thought about taking a melatonin pill. But I could clearly feel my stomach growling, and after watching Wu Banbao’s video, I decided to get up and cook a pack of instant noodles. Eating a bit more might help me sleep better anyway. Took the pill afterward and got ready to sleep.  

### 10:08 Went to Bank of China for Business  

Worried that CSC might fail to re-export my documents, I woke up early and rushed to Bank of China to update my personal information. After that, I activated the card issued by my undergrad school and also applied for a new BOC Global Elite Mastercard in Canadian dollars.  

After finishing at the bank, I went to the supermarket and bought some beef and other vegetables. When I saw the sweet corn, I remembered the huge corn Xiaohuanhuan and I ate in Baiyun District, so I grabbed three more.  

When I got back, I emailed CSC to ask them to re-export my documents, but it doesn’t seem to have made much difference.  

### 17:07 Tidied Up My Room  

Having lived here for a few months, I realized this little nest of mine has gotten messier and messier. It was so messy I couldn’t stand it anymore, so I spent some time cleaning up today. It’s slightly better now.  

### 17:21 Optimized Obsidian Layout  

Using the Commander plugin, I integrated frequently used commands into the sidebar and status bar. Now, adding notes or translating articles is much more convenient.  

### 22:40 Overate  

First time trying to cook beef with jumbo shrimp—it turned out incredibly delicious, so much so that I couldn’t stop eating. But there’s still room for improvement: the beef should have been lightly stir-fried at low heat first instead of being tossed directly into the wok after sautéing the aromatics.  

I also had a big bowl of rice in the afternoon…
