This morning, after having breakfast, I went to work overtime with Huanhuan. I checked into a hotel nearby, planning to prepare some materials in the room. However, I ended up just gathering some information on my phone and lying in bed for a while.  

After Huanhuan finished her overtime, we chatted for a bit, and then her parents called us back for dinner. After eating, we went to the hospital to visit Fengxian, who is about to give birth. We originally wanted to buy flowers, but since it was quite late, we checked two shops but couldnâ€™t find any.  

Instead, we bought some cake and ice cream, played a round of "Hearts" with her colleagues, and then headed home.
