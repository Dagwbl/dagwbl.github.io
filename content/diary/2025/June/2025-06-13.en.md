## 12:20 Taking Bus No. 5 to the Train Station  

This morning, I had a medical check-up arranged by the Emergency Management Bureau. First, I went to the bureau, where Section Chief Wang from the Personnel Department and another colleague accompanied me to the People's Hospital for the examination. These two colleagues were quite strict at first but later seemed a bit tired and couldn’t keep up.  

After the check-up, I took the bus back by myself—they still had some things to wrap up. When I got back, I had a bowl of beef dumpling skins with some Laba garlic. It was quite tasty and not too pungent.  

Sometimes, I really dislike dealing with people, especially those who leave a less-than-favorable impression. Avoiding work or using work time to do other things seems pretty common—maybe everyone does it to some extent.  

## Heading to Guiyang by Train  

Since Xiaohuanhuan’s training ended early today, I changed my train ticket to an earlier high-speed rail. After arriving in Guiyang, I went straight to meet Huanhuan, who said she was getting a massage. After getting off the subway, I followed the navigation to the place, only to find it quite remote, even though it was a newly built building. I felt a bit uneasy—these kinds of places don’t seem very safe. So, I was both worried and a little upset with Huanhuan, and I later told her how I felt.  

## Grabbing a Bite to Eat  

Huanhuan had found a place for snacks, but when we got there, we couldn’t locate it. So, we just picked another random spot nearby. We ordered sour rice noodles, potato wedges, shrimp tarts, and two craft beers. Everything was pretty good, though a bit overpriced. It’s fine for an occasional treat.  

## Visiting Brother Meng’s Place to Catch Up with Long-Time Friends  

As we were nearing the destination, the driver’s phone lost signal due to the many bridges, so we had to take a big detour, delaying us by several minutes. Then, we took a wrong turn, which cost us a few more minutes. When we finally arrived, we found everyone waiting for us to eat. Tingting had prepared a whole table of dishes, all of which were delicious.  

We chatted casually over some beer. Spending time with friends is always comfortable and relaxing. Maybe someday, after settling down, I’ll cook them a little something to show off my skills.  

Since it was getting late and we were too tired to drink more—plus, I had an interview the next day—we decided to leave for Gui’an around 11 p.m. By the time we got there and finished washing up, it was already quite late.
