I woke up quite early today, rummaged through the cabinets, and simply cooked a bowl of noodles to eat.  

Then, I set out on foot to forage for mushrooms in the mountains. At first, I found an entrance to a wooded area, but after just a few steps, I was chased back by a pack of dogs.  

Undeterred, I continued searching and followed the navigation until I finally reached a pine forest, where I managed to pick a few small red mushrooms. Unfortunately, I realized I was too late—most had already been picked by others, leaving only poisonous ones or those I wasn’t sure about.  

As I walked further, I stumbled upon a row of luxury villas, so extravagant that it felt like I’d stepped into a foreign country. It dawned on me that this mountain was essentially their private backyard. Filled with resentment toward the wealthy, I angrily threw the few small mushrooms I’d gathered, along with the plastic bag, onto the ground.  

I kept walking for what felt like ages, only to find that every path seemed blocked by impassable gates. Eventually, I hailed a cab to the Golden Temple, but couldn’t get in from the back entrance. After wandering around for a while longer, I decided to head to the Golden Temple for a stroll.  

The history of the Golden Temple is deeply intertwined with Wu Sangui, which only deepened my reflection on how entrenched class divisions have always been.  

By evening, the sky suddenly darkened as if rain was imminent. I started making my way back to meet Fangfang and Dahuang for dinner. Just as I met up with Fangfang, it began to drizzle, so we hastily ducked into a roadside restaurant serving pickled mustard green and pork trotter hotpot. The food wasn’t great, but I ate a lot because I was starving. We ordered a small pot priced at 48 yuan but ended up paying 89 yuan—what a rip-off.
