Got up early in the morning because I had to go for visa fingerprinting.

Rode my little e-bike and arrived there by 8:30 a.m., even though my appointment was at 9:15. It seemed like arriving early wasn’t exactly appreciated, but they still let me in to queue up.

Then they briefed me, checked my documents, and directed me to a counter. After verifying my details, the staff told me to wait for my number to be called and instructed me to silence my phone and knock before entering when my turn came.

Once inside, I had to read some guidelines, move around in front of the camera, and then do the fingerprinting—which included the odd step of touching my forehead.

On my way back, I passed by Fangfang’s hospital and thought of inviting her for breakfast since she was about to finish her night shift. But she was still busy, so I went alone to have the incredibly delicious rice noodles I’d tried last time.

Got back and called Fei to play games, then took a short nap at noon. In the afternoon, I played games with Fei again, went out for a stroll with Fangfang, and had rice noodles once more.

On the way, we stopped by Metro and were shocked by the absurd prices—it felt like a preview of foreign price tags. We couldn’t bring ourselves to buy much. A small bunch of cilantro cost 13 yuan, which was downright terrifying.

On the way home in the evening, I bought two honeydew melons. My expectations weren’t high, but they turned out to be pretty good.

Spent the rest of the night gaming with Fei until my eyes were blurry, but I managed to help him reach King rank.
