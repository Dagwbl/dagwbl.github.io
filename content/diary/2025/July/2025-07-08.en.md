### 09:14 Trying to Write a Blog Using Voice Input  

By leveraging voice-to-text technology, we can speed up the process of writing blogs. Additionally, using voice input to document our lives can also train our brains, making our thinking more logical and enabling us to express ourselves freely. Moving forward, I’ll strive to use voice input daily to record my life.  

Domestic software’s Chinese voice recognition technology is indeed much better than foreign alternatives, especially apps like Sogou Input, Baidu Input, and iFlytek Input. This very paragraph was created using Sogou Input’s voice-to-text feature. I’ll try to maintain this method for documenting life in the future, while also reducing pauses in my thinking and improving the fluency of my thoughts.

### 15:51 Modern Systems Keep Getting Worse with Updates  

Today, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to quickly switch input methods via the notification panel. This feature has always existed in previous systems, but after upgrading to HyperOS 2, it disappeared. As a result, switching between input methods—especially third-party ones like WeChat Input—has become extremely cumbersome. Even with full-screen optimization enabled and setting a shortcut key for quick input method switching, it still won’t switch to third-party input methods. It’s incredibly frustrating, and after a lot of effort, I still couldn’t find a solution.

### 16:46 Temporarily Solved the Input Method Switching Issue  

I downloaded a "Keyboard Switch" app and pinned it as a tile in the control center, which now allows for relatively convenient input method switching.  

Additionally, voice input seems more convenient with Baidu Input because its voice recognition interface supports commands like "delete" or "enter." It also has a long-text input capability, but to train my thought fluency, I turned it off and didn’t enable long-text input.  

Another concern is privacy with domestic input methods. It’s quite significant—especially when you type certain keywords, and it recommends stickers or other apps. Everything we input is collected by these apps. So, I’d rather trust foreign input methods like Google’s and avoid entering sensitive data with domestic ones.  

It’s also necessary to enable MIUI’s secure keyboard, especially when entering passwords or usernames.

### 22:16 Went for a Walk with Mom and Just Got Back  

I unintentionally fell asleep on the bed and woke up feeling groggy, with a very full stomach, so I thought I’d go out for a walk. Just as I stepped out of the community, Mom called and asked if I wanted to join her for a walk. I agreed and went to meet her.  

Along the way, I taught her how to shop smarter. She wanted to buy a spray cleaner for the range hood, but I told her it might be cheaper online. To give her firsthand experience, I took her to a physical store to buy it while also checking the price online. Unsurprisingly, the online price was 5 yuan cheaper—and this was just for a 20-yuan item.  

I also set up a "Family Card" for her, which gives her a monthly allowance of 300 yuan deducted directly from my Alipay account. Learning to shop online can really save money.  

Additionally, I canceled her mobile plan’s 5-yuan "membership" and 2-yuan "Local Friends Network" fees—unaware that she had been paying for them for so many months.
