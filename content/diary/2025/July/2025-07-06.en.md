Waking up in the morning, I found an unidentified pile of poop on the toilet seat. At first, I suspected it was Huanhuan’s grandpa, but then I learned he had gone outside to use the restroom. So I told Huanhuan I suspected it was her dad, only for her to confess that she had gotten up to use the toilet earlier. While doing her business, she had shifted her butt to the floor to wipe, unknowingly leaving some on the mat. Huanhuan’s grandpa must have noticed but didn’t know how to handle it, so he decided to go outside instead.  

Haha, now I’ve got dirt on her—and I even cleaned it up for her.  

After eating the tomato and egg noodles Huanhuan’s dad made, I got ready to head back to Shuicheng, while Huanhuan had to go to work. We chatted for twenty minutes at the bus stop, and it was really fun. She waited until I got on the bus before leaving for her shift.  

Once in Shuicheng, I went to see my favorite Tony for a shampoo and haircut—he even gave me a facial. I felt completely refreshed afterward. Then I picked up my bank card, went home, showered, and headed to Bank of China to activate it.  

I stopped by the supermarket to buy some rice noodles but forgot to grab eggs.  

Back home, I washed my dirty clothes and lazily lounged in bed scrolling through my phone.
