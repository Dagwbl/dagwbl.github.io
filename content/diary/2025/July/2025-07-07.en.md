The continuous rainy weather has finally stopped, and the scorching heat has arrived. It's so hot that I don't feel like going out at all, so I simply stayed in my rented apartment, waiting for the sun to set before heading out to buy some groceries.  

The morning passed by without accomplishing much. In the afternoon, I thought about brushing up on my English, so I downloaded Duolingo again. To my surprise, Duolingo now offers courses in music and math, which I found quite interesting.  

In the evening, I went out and bought three pounds of eggs and a little over a pound of ground meat. After returning home, I stir-fried the ground meat with shiitake mushrooms to enjoy slowly later. Eggs are about the same price as some vegetables, making them the most cost-effective source of protein for people with lower incomes.
