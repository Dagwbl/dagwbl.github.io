Today was a lazy day.

I didn't finish watching *Justice League* in the car yesterday, so I continued and finished it this morning. In the afternoon, I slept in and then got up to study for a while.

In the evening, my mom called and said they couldn't finish the chicken and asked me to come over to eat it so it wouldn’t go to waste. I didn’t really feel like going—I thought it was a bit of a time-waster. It’s not like I could arrive right at mealtime, eat, and then immediately leave. I’d much rather be on my own.

When I was about to leave after eating, my mom gave me some meat and some vegetables they hadn’t cooked today. I also took the out-of-season quarter-watermelon I had bought myself.
