### 10:06 Stayed up late again  

Electric blankets may affect sleep quality. This is just a speculation, but thinking back to times when I slept well, it was usually when the ambient temperature was lower than the blanket's temperature, and the blanket's warmth was evenly distributed. Electric blankets might create excessive heat or uneven heating, which could disrupt sleep.  

### 12:02 Integrating Conventional Commits  

Implemented Conventional Commits into the submission workflow. Since it's a blog repository, I added the main article types. Later, I can analyze my commit history to track how I spend my time.  

### 15:19 Doing laundry  

> Information, for humans, is like food and sexual desire.  

As long as a person can continuously consume information, even someone without deep thoughts will experience a kind of physiological satisfaction. This is also why people are so obsessed with gossip.  

This process may seem harmless, but it consumes a lot of time and leaves people feeling exhausted and empty.  

Properly controlling and resisting such temptations allows us to recognize our own existence—rather than just being a vessel for generating and filling desires.  

### 23:56 Late at night  

Migrated Typehco's articles to Hugo and did some initial optimizations for the `archives` page.

There are still so many things I want to do but haven't gotten around to. Time to sleep—I'll tackle them tomorrow when I wake up.
