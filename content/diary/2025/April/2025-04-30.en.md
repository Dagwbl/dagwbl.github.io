I hadn’t even woken up yet when my mom anxiously called me in the morning. I quickly contacted the driver and booked a ride for 8:40.  

After arriving at Pingdi, I hurriedly got out of the car and ended up dropping my luggage. We went to the restaurant where Zhang Jing’s wedding was held, and my mom handed me 200 yuan to give as a gift. I really dislike these kinds of things, but I couldn’t be bothered to argue. After the meal, I just walked over and handed the money over.  

This was the first time my mom had been away from home for so long, so she was overjoyed to be returning. Her steps were so light it seemed like she couldn’t wait to run home.  

The neighboring village had one celebration after another—what might seem like trivial matters are often the most meaningful.  

I was really looking forward to this trip home, mainly because I wanted to see my sister, Manman, and Ningning. Manman and Ningning were as adorable and happy as ever.
