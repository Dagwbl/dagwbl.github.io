Last night, I managed to sleep fairly well, though I went to bed a bit late.

Exams really cost a lot of money, especially since hotels turn into a seller's market during exam periods and inevitably raise their prices. Many hotels have hiked their rates to such an extent that they might as well be publicly shamed on a lamppost. 

Candidates are truly pitiable—most of them don’t even have stable jobs. The exams themselves are hard enough, and yet they still have to endure being exploited by these people.

Complimenting others is actually quite nice. Last night, the driver I had booked stood me up, and a taxi happened to come pick me up instead. I praised the driver for her excellent skills, and she ended up sharing a lot about her life with me.

The exam didn’t go so well, though. I messed up transferring and filling in the answer sheet. I had the correct answers calculated but didn’t write them down—so frustrating. It took me several minutes to calm down and focus on the essay section. For the first question, I had already finished writing but thought of adding more, only to exceed the word limit. It was really annoying. These little details still need more practice.

After the exam, I grabbed a shared bike and rode to Haina Plaza to find something to eat. Nothing really appealed to me, so after some thought, I ordered a KFC single meal. I asked the staff to verify my coupon, but she told me to do it myself on the app. Feeling a bit annoyed and considering my slow phone, I just left. At the station, I ended up eating the eggs I had in my bag and the mooncakes Huanhuan bought for me.

Huanhuan took me to eat sour soup fish noodles, and I was so hungry that I finished even the soup. We walked home and also had some big gluten skewers on the way. I told Huanhuan about an Indian movie I had watched part of on the bus today—*Karma*, and after we got home, we continued watching it. Her mom couldn’t stand the bloody scenes and went back to her own room. We stayed up very late before going to bed.
