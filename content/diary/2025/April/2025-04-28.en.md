Huanhuan had a speech competition at the municipal branch today, so she practiced several times last night.  

Earlier, she mentioned she wanted to eat crayfish. In the morning, while she went to the competition, I went to Jiahui Supermarket and bought 3.6 jin (approx. 1.8 kg) of crayfish. On the way back, I saw an uncle selling local strawberries and bought some as well.  

I’ve never cooked crayfish completely on my own before, but it didn’t seem too difficult. However, handling the crayfish was a bit troublesome. When I bought them, I specifically picked live ones, but processing them felt somewhat cruel.  

The crayfish turned out quite tasty, though toward the end, the flavor became too intense, making it a bit hard to enjoy.

> Once the crayfish are braised to the desired taste, they should be removed promptly to prevent the flavor from becoming too strong.
