Woke up in the middle of the night suddenly wanting to listen to this song. In the morning, after waiting for Huanhuan to wake up, I asked Xiao Ai to have Jeff Chang sing it for us.

Every separation always brings a tinge of reluctance, but today’s emotions felt particularly strong.

We went to a place called Panxian Flavor for breakfast, having sticky rice, mushroom meatball noodles, and meat pies. Afterward, she went to attend a team-building event organized by the city branch, while I picked up a package and wandered around.

A few days ago, I submitted my resume at the Guizhou Talent Expo. This afternoon, the Energy Bureau called to ask if I was certain about joining. Personally, I’m not too keen—there’s a five-year service commitment, the benefits aren’t great, and if it involves frequent mine visits, I’d be quite averse to it. For now, I agreed to see how things unfold.

Later, I chatted with Niuwa, who mentioned that her colleague has a friend in the Energy Bureau and gave me a brief rundown of the situation. The meal allowance they provide is only enough for 13 meals a month, and the dormitory is still a communal setup. This isn’t talent recruitment—it’s more like recruiting workhorses. Niuwa then mentioned that her boyfriend is in Gui'an and said the benefits there are quite good, suggesting I give it a try.

### 20:19 Continued refining Obsidian-compatible callout folding

Noticed that Hugo’s source code supports folding tags, so I spent some effort combining it with AI to achieve callout folding compatible with Obsidian.

> CSS always has its share of inexplicable issues. With flex as the parent node, the span tags inside never seem to center vertically.

### 22:02 Packed up some things

Heading home with Mom tomorrow.
