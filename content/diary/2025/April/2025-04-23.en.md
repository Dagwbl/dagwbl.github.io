**Ingredients**: One tomato, two eggs.  
**Additional ingredients**: Ginger, garlic leaves, small chili peppers, water.

Steps as follows:  
1. After heating the pan, add slightly more oil than usual for stir-frying.  
2. Beat the eggs, and once the oil is hot, pour them in. When most of the eggs have set, start stirring to help the uncooked parts come into contact with the hot oil.  
3. Remove the eggs just before they start to turn golden brown.  
4. There should still be a small amount of oil left in the pan. Once the oil is hot again, add minced ginger.  
5. Dice the tomato and add it to the pan, stir-frying over low heat. Occasionally press the tomato with a spatula to release its juices, adding a pinch of salt to speed up the process and a splash of soy sauce for extra moisture.  
6. Once the tomato in the pan has turned into a paste but still retains some diced pieces, add about 1.5 eggshells' worth of water. Continue stir-frying over low heat for about 2 minutes, then add the small chili peppers.  
7. Turn the heat up to high, add the scrambled eggs back in, and stir-fry until evenly mixed.  
8. Turn off the heat, sprinkle with garlic leaves, and stir-fry to combine.  
9. Serve.  

The result is melt-in-your-mouth, fragrant, and tender scrambled eggs with tomatoes.  

### 22:13 Eye Discomfort

If only there were a little split personality in my head to supervise me in doing positive things regularly every day. I always feel like I'm tired and need a break, but when I do rest, I don’t rest properly—I unconsciously end up opening various apps on my phone. As a result, I don’t get enough rest, and the things I actually want to do don’t get done well either.
