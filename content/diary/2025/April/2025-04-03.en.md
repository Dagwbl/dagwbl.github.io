### 09:30 Waking Up  

Lately, my sleep schedule has been irregular, making it hard to fall asleep. When I lie awake and observe my thoughts, I realize that on the surface, I don’t seem stressed, but my mind is flooded with all sorts of distracting and annoying thoughts.  

- Where do I need to go tomorrow? What do I need to do? And the day after? This is the most fragmented and complicated question.  
- How’s my CSC application going? Why hasn’t it been processed yet? How should I respond to different possible outcomes?  
- I might not finish all the food I bought—what should I cook tomorrow, or what should I do with it?  
- Suddenly remembered an idea for fixing an unresolved bug on my website—feels like I should jump up and work on it right away. What other optimizations can I make?  
- I haven’t read a book in a long time, and my mind feels empty. I really dislike short-form videos; I should treat them like enemies.  
- What happens if I stay awake for too long? Will it affect important tasks tomorrow or the day after?  
- Gotta take a photo of little Huanhuan.  
- Oh, I should also shower tomorrow.  
- What might my friends and family be up to these days…  
- Suddenly feel like buying something, but I don’t have much money left—maybe look for alternatives. Then I remind myself not to buy non-essentials. And then I think, having a stable monthly income would be nice.  
- I remember going a long time without insomnia—what’s going on lately? Need to reflect on what’s different about my current state and make sure I don’t slip into depression.

### 10:43 Spent Some Time Organizing My Blog  

Realized my old blog was a mess—lots of tiny, trivial posts that didn’t deserve standalone entries. Also, categorizing articles is an important issue—it needs to be logical. Ideally, it should be based on the file directory structure, with additional fine-tuning via frontmatter tags.  

### 10:45 Remembering the Past  

Thought back to when I first created my blog—I even encouraged others to contribute content, imagining that one day we could compile our writings into a book. Looking back, that idea still feels romantic and meaningful.  

In the future, I should focus on learning, absorbing, creating, and sharing. With little Huanhuan by my side, I’ll probably stick with it even longer.  

### 15:58 Getting Ready to Go Out

I took the meat to my brothers, then got ready to take the bus to Hongguo.
