### 09:47 Learned a new git command: stash

This command is very useful when syncing files between different devices.

### 15:08 Prepare to go home

In the morning, I went out to practice my English speaking on the lawn. Learning a language by speaking is a useful method. I think I should insist on this way.

At noon, I submitted the Mine 610 assignment to Canvas and sent the concrete assignment to the teacher's email. I felt a little bit nervous, because I want to get an excellent score, and this is my first assignment in English.

The time in the afternoon is always tiring and boring, so I want to go outside to enjoy the nice weather and the beautiful nature.
