It was almost noon, and then I dug out a box of pizza and put it into the oven. It really wasn't delicious at all, but my roommate said it's not bad. Alright.

I sent a message to Dr. Zhao and invited him to go hiking and enjoy the beautiful fall. I took a shower after quickly eating lunch.

Dr. Zhao walked so fast that I had to walk very hard so that I could follow him. We walked more than 10 kilometers. 

After a while, I was getting thirsty due to forgetting to bring water. Fortunately, I picked some wild apples on the side of the road. We walked for about 2 hours. 

Finally, I treated him to a cold beverage. So cool and so comfortable! 

After going home, I made two bags of Chinese instant noodles and added many extra vegetables. It's the taste of home.
