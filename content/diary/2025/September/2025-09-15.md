In the morning, I cleaned our house because the cleaner will spray insecticides today.

I did some assignments on the day. 

In the afternoon, Dr. Zhao, Dr. Chatranga, Amirthan and I went to buy some coffee. I don't like drinking coffee, but I would like to hang out with someone.

After getting back home, ZJ made some noodles to share with me. It's not bad.

Perhaps due to drink too much coffee, I felt sleepy, but I can't get to sleep.
