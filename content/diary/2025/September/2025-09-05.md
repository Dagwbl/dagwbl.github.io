### 10:18 Most of All things are  settled down

I already can write blog on my new computer at office. Everything is becoming good over time.

### 15:36 Orientation with Professor Liu

objectives, money, future

After the noon's class, Amirthan and I go to the Dr. Liu's office. He said he will give me a orientation.

The key words of  the orientation are about the objectives, money and future. But so many content we talk about, I can't write all of things. The core concepts is as follow:

- We must learn how to concentrate on our research
- Do not work for long time, 40 hours a week is enough
- Do save money, take care of ourself
- Keep the private time, keep respect with each other

### Finished the Config of New Computer

There is nothing in my home. So I don't want to go home even after 5 PM. I utilized this time to set up my blog config and complete the internet appointment.

May be I should learn how to relax and enjoy Life. Canada is a beatiful contry, We should take more time for the nature.
