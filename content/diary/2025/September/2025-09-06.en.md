## Go Shopping with ZJ

We ate too much bread and hamburgers last week, so we decided to go to Walmart to buy some food and household items.

ZJ emptied his travel box to carry the goods. He wanted to walk to the mall, but I was a bit reluctant. In the end, I agreed with his idea.

We bought a lot of items, including vegetables, a pot, bowls, and so on.

## First Home-Cooked Rice Meal

I bought 2kg of rice myself in the afternoon, so I decided to make Chinese food for dinner.

This was my first rice meal since arriving in Edmonton, and it was delicious. ZJ ate a lot, and I also enjoyed it, though I only had one bowl.

## Collecting Second-Hand Furniture

After dinner, ZJ asked me to post an ad to buy some second-hand furniture like desks and lamps. I left both of our phone numbers, with ZJ’s listed first. Jenny was very helpful—I was worried about getting nonstop calls, so having two numbers seemed better.

Soon enough, someone contacted us about selling furniture. They lived nearby and even picked us up to choose the items at their place.

I picked out a desk, a mattress, chairs, and more. It cost quite a bit, but we probably won’t need to buy much more furniture after this.

The seller gave us a mirror for free. At first, I thought it was nice, but after bringing it home, it felt eerie, so we threw it away. It’s better not to casually accept things from others.

## Tidying Up My Little Room

I cleaned the desk and chairs and rearranged the layout of the room, making it much cozier. The mattress is also very comfortable—it’s great!

PS: My English writing is still quite poor, so I used translation software for help and manually copied it over. I’ll improve gradually.
