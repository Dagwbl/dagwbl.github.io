### 12:22 Make up yesterday's diary

Recording a diary in real-time is better than writing many diaries at once.

### Divergence

ZJ came back home with a lot of things he bought, but he said that the things I didn't need would split the bill, because all the things were what he wanted. 

It's okay, maybe we can buy ourselves food in the future. Undoubtedly, this is a good thing for me. However, the relationship between us made me upset.

### 16:08 Bored

I need to make more friends in Edmonton; otherwise, life is so boring. Days repeat day by day is not what I want.

### 22:24 Preparing to go to sleep

I washed my dirty clothes in the afternoon. It is unnecessary to use a washing machine if I don't have too many clothes.

I wanted to make pork stewed with vermicelli for tomorrow's lunch; however, ZJ ate it with me, and he made the pasta for me for tomorrow.

I spent too much time on Wild Drift (lolm foreign version), and it is naive that I wanted to learn English from this game.
