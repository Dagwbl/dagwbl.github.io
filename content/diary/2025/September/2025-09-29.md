I stayed up all night yesterday to finish my homework. I went to bed at six in the morning and still haven’t fallen asleep.

It's so sad. I have a group meeting at noon, and I have to be the host. I will come back after the group meeting.

In the afternoon, I went to get a free haircut with Amirthan. I didn’t like the fact that my hair was cut by three people.
