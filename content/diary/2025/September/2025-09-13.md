Today was a boring day.

I woke up early, and then I continue sleep again. I cooked noodles with some vegetables as lunch for us. 

In the afternoon, I decided to go to the T&T supermarket to buy some grocery and some food. I don't want to do anything while I am alone.

In the evening, I wanted to have a look for assignment of sensor course. I found that this assignment was very interesting, though it had a little difficult. To finish this assignment, there are a lot of programming skills and computer skills what I really am good at.

I hope I can get the excellent grade in this course. 

Come on!
