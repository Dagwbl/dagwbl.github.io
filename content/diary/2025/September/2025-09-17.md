Too many diaries are needed to write. I am tired.

Today is a shy day. I studied for a while in the morning. Afternoon, I had some coffee with my classmate, Dr. Zhao, who ordered for me because I forgot to link my bank card with the App.

I went to a mixer with Amirthan. I am always shy and introverted in these situations.

I hated myself. Especially the English is very poor.
