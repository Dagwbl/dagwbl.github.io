### 12:05 Waiting for class

I am afraid of I don't have enough time to eat, so I ate my lunch early.

In the morning, I pre-learned the content of today's lecture, and I might feel better while in class.

### 15:02 Feel a little tired

Communication via Email is a very efficient way. Today I received a lot of Email about my roll-in, funding. I only see the school's staff in person once, due to re-image my computer, otherwise we just sit in front of the computer, and then all things will be done.

## Starving

Because I ate too less lunch, I felt hungry and sleepy. So I went home at 4:30 PM, and I cost $10 to buy a pan of India food. 

I was still hungry, I quickly went to the University station, and then take the train to go to home. I cooked some pasta and double-cooked meat for dinner.

The oven had a some spots which was dirty after a long cooking. I do my best to clean it, and it just had a little effect. Whatever, I cooked the eggs with tomatoes for tomorrow's lunch.

I'm so tired that I didn't finish the journal in the office.
