Time always goes so fast.

In the morning, I felt colder than before. I quickly washed my face and brushed my teeth, and then took some rice into my lunch box.

I was the first arrival at the office. I just did some check-in procedure; the time went to noon. 

There was a group meeting at noon. I was a little nervous about the group meeting because I hadn't done too much last week.

In the afternoon, I just replied to some emails and helped Amirthan with the assignment for the sensing technique class.

Maybe I should spend more time at home.
