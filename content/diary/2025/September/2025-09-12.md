### 15:06 A little difficult

Writing in English is still a little difficult for me, and it is related to my speaking capacity. My brain is still a Chinese brain. Before speaking, it needs to be translated into Chinese first.

Therefore, what I should to do is insisting practice my writing and speaking skill by writing diaries and speaking everything.

### Writing diary

In the morning, Tellus's staff followed the appointment and called me to install the WiFi router. I came out of the apartment to pick him up.

I don't know whether I should have paid a tip to him. ChatGPT said, You don't need to pay a tip to him, because they are the employees of Tellus.

After finishing it, I ate a banana and then took the train to go to school. I bought Spotify Premium with a student offer yesterday, so I installed this software on my office computer this morning.

A few moments later, I went to the Sensing course. This classroom is very cold, at least for the three of us, that's the case. And the course time covered the whole noon, we didn't have time to have lunch. It will be better than the afternoon in winter, the teacher said.

Writing more words is always good. Today is a nice day, and I found that I could gradually understand what others said.
