This diary was written on Sep 12, 2025, because I felt so tired yesterday.

There were two classes yesterday. The first one is Principles of Mining Engineering, and the second class is Concrete Materials in Practice. The first should be easy for me, but it became difficult in the English environment, so I need to put in extra effort to learn it after the class. About the second class, there are too many chemical terms and concrete terms. That's why I feel it's difficult; even my classmate who is from Shiri Laka also felt it was a little difficult.

It's already 8 PM after class. ZJ made some pasta for me. My sister and mom called me while ZJ was cooking.

Not a bad day.
