Today is a brave man day. 

In the morning, I talked to the Bell staff who helped me get a phone card. I told her that I solved my problem yesterday. She was very happy and asked about the conditions of using Tellus. I even taught her how to set the DNS to boost the Chinese service.

Then I went to the TD ATM to withdraw some money, and then I deposited this money into the RBC bank.

I bought a hot dog, which cost me CA$7.89. This is a simple robbery. Unfortunately, some sauce from the hot dog accidentally dropped on my pants. The spot position was just in the middle of my groin. I'm so embarrassed. Fortunately, I bought a tissue today.

I had an appointment with Mr. Robert. I was a little afraid of talking to the teacher. The ending is good because Mr. Robert is very patient and kind.
