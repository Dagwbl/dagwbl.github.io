I got up early in the morning, prepared some breakfast, and went out to take the train.

Since I received a $120 bill from Fido the day before yesterday, I was still feeling a bit upset about it. So today I think I should go ask Bell, because the people at Bell had promised me that no money would be charged.

The Bell staff spent an hour helping me, but still couldn't get in touch with anyone from Fido-totally ridiculous. In the end, I asked the person who helped me open the account, and even the manager of Bell, who was already at work. The consistent answer I got was that no money would be deducted, which put my mind at ease.

At school, I started working on my coursework. Doing assignments in English is still quite difficult for me, and I don't even know how to get a lot of resources I need.

By the afternoon, I had basically finished the homework, so I got ready to slip back home and cook. At home, I fried some rice and boiled some vegetables. Cooking for myself feels a lot more casual and free.

Oh, and since I bricked my old phone yesterday, today I secretly took a break and flashed Lineage OS on it. With the school's network, it should work pretty well, and all the Google apps are connecting normally.
