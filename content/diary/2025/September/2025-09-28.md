Today is also a day to catch up on homework. The busier I am, the more I have to cook. 

Today I stewed pork ribs myself and made beef spring rolls in the evening. They were very delicious.

In the afternoon, I went to help Amirthan solve his homework problems for the afternoon.

Chat PGT is still not very reliable when it comes to complex issues. The more you help, the more confused you become. You still have to rely on yourself.
