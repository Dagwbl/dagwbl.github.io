Got up lazily in the morning, already forgot what I did.

Near noon, I cooked some pasta, added my twice-cooked pork ,and brought it to school to study for a while. Reviewed the class PPT again, tried to guess the teacher's intentions for the assignment questions, and wrote a rough outline.

In the afternoon, I came back and made beef fried rice. It was really delicious. Then I took a shower and washed my dirty socks and clothes.

I thought about going to the gym to have a look. I kind of wanted to go swimming, but I didn't have the gear. While chat with Huan, it turned out she was just about to buy it for me. 

That's great!
