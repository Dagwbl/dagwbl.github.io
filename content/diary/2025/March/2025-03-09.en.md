Recently, there have been quite a few changes, and that sense of uncertainty has once again filled my vision.

All the materials are almost ready. Next, I'll organize them and get the necessary signatures and stamps. I'll try to find some time to submit the materials soon.

Today, I bought a printer. From now on, I can print things myself, and even print photos, which makes me quite happy.

Let's give it my best tomorrow!
