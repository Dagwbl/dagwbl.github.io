### 09:31 Started Studying  

Just finished debugging the code. There are always so many things to do in my own room—thinking about folding laundry, taking out the trash, what to eat for lunch… Before I knew it, a lot of time was wasted on these little tasks.  

### 21:41 Finished a Vocational Aptitude Test  

Scored in the top 35%. It was okay—still plenty of room for improvement.  

This afternoon, I completed a set of "Comprehensive Application Ability" exercises, then cooked some rice and went grocery shopping in my pajama pants. Bought a lot of stuff: strawberries, choy sum, cabbage, tofu, and pork belly. Originally planned to make it last two days, but I got greedy and wanted to eat everything. Ended up not being able to finish it all by myself, so I called my brother over to share the meal.

My brother had to work overtime at noon and didn't come over until 1 PM. I ate two bowls of rice at lunch and then three more bowls in the evening. Cooking for myself is terrifying—I always end up eating too much.
