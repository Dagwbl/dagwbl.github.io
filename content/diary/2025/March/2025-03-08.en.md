Today, I slept in with little Huanhuan. What did we have for lunch?

Oh no, my memory is failing me.

Oh, right!!!

We cooked tomato and egg noodles, my way.

There was also some braised beef that my brother bought earlier, which we hadn't finished yet. We polished it off together. We added a few slices of ham to the noodles, which made it especially delicious.

Then we bought a nasal rinse. Haha, it was my first time rinsing my nose, quite an experience.

But lately, there's been blood in my nose, which is a bit scary.

In the afternoon, we went out with my brother and had beef, dry pot, and tomatoes. It was okay, but not as good as the one from Four Grids.

My brother moved away from Huayu Cave, and my sister-in-law came to Shuicheng. That's good too.
