Today was a day out for fun, and we got up lazily.

Fangfang was on duty all day today and couldn't join us. We managed to trick Lao Sao into coming over at noon, and he even brought his own potatoes. Then, Da Huang went to buy some oyster mushrooms to fry. The fried potatoes and fried oyster mushrooms were simply delicious.

We also visited the Expo Park today, but it wasn't very exciting as there were charges everywhere. We strolled around casually, and at the end, we sang songs with a few outgoing and optimistic uncles and aunties outside the guard booth, which was quite a social experience.

We came back and Dahuang bought a net online, so we grabbed a small basin and went to catch crayfish. As expected, we came back empty-handed, and the feeling wasn't great. In the evening, we went home and played Bomb Cat with Huanhuan for a while, which was quite fun.
