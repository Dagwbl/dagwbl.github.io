Whenever things become slightly unknown or complicated, I start to feel lazy and unmotivated.

However, I still managed to print out the necessary documents. In the afternoon, after consulting with Manager Liu and Fangfang, we decided to head to Kunming overnight.

It was already eleven o'clock when I arrived at Fangfang and Dahuang's place, and Dahuang had even fried some potatoes waiting for me.
