I don't know when the sky brightened; I got up without opening my eyes.

After a quick wash, I hailed a cab and went straight to Zhongqing Company. I got the necessary stamps, treated Brother Deng from the company to lunch at noon, and had a couple of drinks. The alcohol content was quite high, and by the time I finished eating and drinking, I was already feeling dizzy.

In the afternoon, I came back and slept until four o'clock, then got up to find a print shop to print some documents. In the evening, I had dinner with Da Huang, Fangfang, and Lao Sao. They were too eager to pay the bill.

In the evening, when I got back, my younger cousin helped me sign all the documents that needed to be supplemented.
