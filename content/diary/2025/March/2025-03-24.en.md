I slept very well last night and didn’t wake up until 8 o’clock this morning.  

I dragged myself out of bed slowly. The day before yesterday, I received an email stating that I would receive an annual funding of 25,000 CAD, with a minimum of 100,000 CAD over four years. At the time, the email mentioned logging into the system to accept the offer, so I spent the entire morning today checking but couldn’t find any new information to accept. I gave up.  

In the afternoon, I worked on some "Administrative Aptitude Test" exercises. I realized that the electronic version I bought online was quite poor—printing out the test papers and doing them by hand was uncomfortable. It would have been better to just take the tests directly on the Fenbi official website.  

Later, I cooked rice for dinner. While the rice was cooking, I went out to buy some fish mint. For dinner, I made stir-fried fish mint with ham, fried potatoes, vegetable soup, and cold-tossed fish mint. Everything was delicious, and I ended up eating two full bowls of rice.

In the evening, Professor Yu called to ask about the progress of my CSC application, and I felt quite guilty. In the future, I should promptly update my advisor on any developments regarding such matters. It was wrong of me to assume that the professor might have forgotten and avoid reaching out.
