This morning, I got up slowly and leisurely, and since my hair was quite oily, I decided to wash it.

I took a taxi to the Provincial Department of Education. I spent 6.5 yuan to photocopy a document at a nearby print shop. Printing things outside is really expensive. Color copies cost 1 yuan per page, and black and white copies cost 0.5 yuan per pageâ€”it's practically robbery. I still feel like buying my own printer was a good investment, as I can now frequently print things like record sheets and such.

At the entrance of the Department of Education stood a young guy, seemingly there for reception but actually there to intercept, probably worried I might bring in some documents or items. Once inside the building, I asked at two offices in a row, but neither was the External Exchange Center.

Following the address I was given, I went to the second floor of a nearby bookstore. I found the office, but no one was there. Then I ran into a security guard, Cui Zishan, who patiently explained the situation to me. He left me a phone number and said he could help me inquire tomorrow.

About an hour later, I received a call from Uncle Cui, telling me to come up and check. When I went up, sure enough, someone was in the office. That was great.

There was a minor issue with the materials, but Teacher Du still accepted them. With that, today's tasks were completed. Then I wandered around outside and somehow ended up by Cuihu Lake. I saw the Lu Han Residence, the Yunnan Military Academy, and the Wen Yiduo Former Residence.

It was the first time I had seen so many of Mr. Wen Yiduo's poems, paintings, and seal carvings. His talent is enviable, and his integrity, bravery, and fearlessness are truly admirable.

Mr. Wen Yiduo is the person I aspire to become.
