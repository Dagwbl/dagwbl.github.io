Since Sister Nan left, trivial matters have piled up. Although it's possible that after this week, things might not be as busy, I've already informed Sister Nan and the section chief that I won't be continuing after this week.

I'm thinking of setting aside ample time to prepare for my own affairs, as I'm quite lacking in many aspects. Regarding the CSC application, my understanding of the policies is insufficient, and my preparation of materials is not thorough enough. As for exams, I haven't done enough practice questions and haven't simulated the exams under timed conditions.

So, resigning is also a way to invest more time in myself, without making excuses.

Every time I resign, I always think about what I will lose afterward, rarely focusing on what I gain. Indeed, compared to what I gain, the losses seem quite significant, such as the monthly salary (even though it's the minimum wage), the cafeteria's breakfast and lunch, the quiet environment, and some people I've just met. All I have is time, or more precisely, uninterrupted blocks of time. I used to have plenty of time as well, but it was often fragmented by various trivial matters. When it comes to writing, composing papers, and similar tasks, I find it difficult to make use of fragmented time—this is my shortcoming.
