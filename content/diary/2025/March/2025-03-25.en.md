The weather is so nice today! Yet I didn't step outside all day.  

I was sluggish in the morning, fiddling with this and that, and before I knew it, the morning was gone. The printer keeps acting up a little—I’ll send it back and try a replacement.  

Today, I worked through a set of practice tests. The *Administrative Aptitude Test* was manageable, but I still need more practice with summarization and synthesis for the *Comprehensive Application Ability* section. I should also familiarize myself with the basic formats of various writing styles. Tomorrow, I’ll tackle a few more test papers specifically to sharpen those skills.  

I called home today to ask Mom how things were going. She said the land has been leased out, the cows have been sold, and the pigs are still a bit underpriced. Then my sister took Mom’s phone to talk to me—Ningning and Manman were as cheerful as ever. I noticed tears welling up in my sister’s eyes but didn’t press her about it at the time. Only after hanging up did I realize why. So, I wrote her a letter ([letter_20250325201618.en](../../../letter/letter_20250325201618.en.md)), hoping it might bring her some comfort.

This noon, I stir-fried some Chinese toon, but it wasn't particularly tasty. Instead, the toon aroma filled the entire room. After stir-frying it again, it turned out somewhat better.
