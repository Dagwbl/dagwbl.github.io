In order to find a company to affiliate with, I can qualify for the CSC application. Paying to work is something that could only happen to me, and 1400 a month is quite a lot. It's a bit outrageous, but there's no other way. Coincidentally, Mr. Liu asked me for money, so I also mentioned to him about getting his seal, and it's only natural that I'll be heading to Kunming next week.

I couldn't fall asleep during my midday nap, as there's quite a lot on my mind.

In the blink of an eye, the day is over. I need to hurry up, take a shower, wash the dishes, and get ready to head to Guiyang for the exam.

Today is a day when I might get to see little Huanhuan.
