Kunming finally saw clear skies today after several overcast days.

This morning, Da Huang Fangfang took us to a nearby place where we had some particularly delicious and affordable rice noodles and vermicelli. We ate until we were quite full.

We also visited the Luoyu River Wetland Park, where we bought two small nets to catch tiny fish and shrimp. Today was much better than yesterday, and we managed to catch quite a few small ones.

Time flew by quickly, and soon it was time to head back. I had also thought about visiting Fangfang's home to see her younger sister, but we didn't get the chance.

At 4:20 PM, I returned to Panzhou with Huanhuan. Huanhuan then accompanied me to the bus station in Panzhou, where I caught a bus to Shuicheng.

I stayed quite alert on the bus, feeling a bit tired but not inclined to sleep.

Came back and did some laundry.
