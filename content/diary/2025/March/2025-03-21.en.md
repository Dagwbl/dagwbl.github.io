The materials were submitted yesterday.

Early this morning, little Huanhuan arrived, and we went to Yunnan University Hospital, then to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital. In between, we also checked my lingual frenulum, and the doctor said it was normal. Haha, I felt a little disappointed.

In the evening, we had dinner together at the same place where I had previously eaten with Brother Deng Zhongqing.

Old Sao is really quick when it comes to giving money, it's done in the blink of an eye. From now on, I'll have to prepay the money there first.
