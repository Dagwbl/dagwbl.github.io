### 09:30 Insomnia Last Night

Naturally, waking up this morning felt exhausting, and I had zero desire to get out of bed. Yet, my biological clock rudely dragged me awake early anyway.

The main reason for the insomnia is my irregular sleep schedule. Deviating from my usual bedtime often leads to sleeplessness. Both the night before last and last night were like this. So far, I’ve found two effective solutions:

1. **Indulge my desires to exhaustion**: By physically tiring myself out, I can trigger hormone release that helps me fall asleep faster.
2. **Don’t even try to sleep**: Instead, learn something new—especially by listening to lectures, like math or English. The more attentively I listen, the quicker I drift off. The catch? As a lazy person, forcing myself to study is tough. It takes practice.

### 11:34 Cooking Lunch and Taking a Shower

Stir-fried some cabbage, fried two eggs, and tossed in yesterday’s leftover fried potatoes and sausages. Mixed it all with rice in the pan, along with the boiled veggies from yesterday—delicious!

Showering is such a refreshing experience. It washes away the grimy aura that seems to cling to us after waking up, leaving me feeling clear-headed and revitalized.

### 12:08 Explaining *Tuihēng*

In the *Whale* group chat, someone mentioned Xiao Kun drinking, and I described him with the term <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">*tuihēng*</mark>. It dawned on me that others don’t usually use this word—it’s probably a local dialect. Here’s my definition:

> [!note]
> **Tuī Hēng**  
> To put it vividly: When someone is unwilling, reluctant, or afraid to face a situation or person, they bury their head in their belly button or armpit. If someone calls their name or nudges them, they respond with vague grunts or deflect the topic, hoping the moment will just pass.

### 12:55 Finished Debugging Code

Fixed the rating display to show the day of the week when no rating is set. Debugging is always a hassle, especially when I’m unfamiliar with the code. The most effective approach? Stay calm and methodically log outputs to diagnose the issue.

### 17:52 Getting Ready to Head Out

After finishing a set of exam papers, having dinner, and washing the dishes, I set off for the train station. I’ll get to see little Huanhuan soon.
