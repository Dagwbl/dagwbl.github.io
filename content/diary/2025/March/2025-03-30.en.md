## 2025-03-29

Yesterday, I went to Qingzhen to take a public institution exam—I had applied for the Guizhou Academy of Social Sciences. Xiaohuanhuan came along to accompany me, and spending these last two days with her has been so much fun.  

On the 29th, we had some spicy braised food, which was *really* spicy, and the ingredients didn’t seem all that fresh either. The next day, both of us had stomach issues. I should probably buy less of this kind of food in the future—making it myself might be better.  

I performed terribly on the exam, constantly distracted and feeling really frustrated. But now that it’s over, I’ll just let it go.  

At noon, we went to a small hotpot place near Xiaokun’s place. We were so hungry that everything tasted amazing. After eating, we spontaneously decided to go to Anshun for some fun.  

In the evening, we visited Anshun’s Little Cross area, strolled through the food street, and explored the ancient town. Anshun has *so* many delicious foods—after eating around, we even went for some big skewer barbecue. We were stuffed to the point of numbness.  

Back at our accommodation, we played Exploding Kittens and ended up staying up late again.

Today, Xiaokun took us to eat yellow catfish with green peppers. There were *so* many chilies and Sichuan peppercorns—it was legitimately numbing and spicy, but still pretty good.  

After overeating, we took a walk along the river and returned to Little Cross. The food street was just as lively during the day as it was at night. We bought some rice paper rolls (*xiaoguojuan*), which were *seriously* delicious. We also grabbed some meat pies—next time, I’ll try the *posu* buns.  

I took the leftover rice paper rolls and the chips Xiaohuanhuan bought to my brother and sister-in-law’s place. They weren’t as good as when they were fresh. We had dinner at my brother’s, and afterward, he and I drove the car to park it at the stadium.  

It’s been a while since I last drove, so I felt a bit rusty.

Added a visitor statistics feature to my blog and also fixed a bug with Giscus theme switching. Now the theme changes successfully on the first attempt.

By the way, I took a photo that I really like.
