Today is the last day of the Dragon Boat Festival, which also means the end of our family's brief reunion.  

Early in the morning, Mom and Dad were busy reheating and eating the leftovers. After breakfast, they had to catch their bus, so Huanhuan and I washed the dishes. Then we went to my sister’s place to hang out for a while and help carry some things.  

Ningning always struggles the most with goodbyes, unable to hold back her emotions. Manman, being a little older now, has gotten better at masking and disguising her feelings, trying to be the well-behaved child in Mom’s eyes. I’m not sure if that’s a good thing or not.  

Huanhuan and I rode our little scooter through the rain to catch the shuttle bus. The rain wasn’t heavy at first, but the cars speeding by splashed water straight into our faces. We got lucky—the bus was about to leave just as we sat down.  

I dozed off on the bus and arrived in no time. Her parents weren’t home, so we stayed for a bit. Then we went into town to look at some apartments—living by the roadside was pretty noisy. After that, we grabbed some KFC, but I had to leave before finishing the fries. I probably could’ve finished them, but I didn’t want to risk it. And somehow, I absentmindedly ended up taking Huanhuan’s water with me.
