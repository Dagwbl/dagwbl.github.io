Saturday was the 2025 Guizhou Provincial Exam. On Friday night, I rushed to Guiyang overnight, and after work, Xiao Huanhuan also came from Panzhou to accompany me for the exam. It was both an exam and a date.

The exam lasted the entire day on Saturday, and the timing was extremely tight. As soon as I arrived at the test center, I felt the urgent need to use the restroom. However, each floor had only one restroom, and although the building appeared to have four floors, it was actually a quadrangle-style structure with four single floors combined. By the time it was my turn, there were only fifteen minutes left before the exam started. While waiting for someone else to finish, my mind was racing with thoughtsâ€”should I just relieve myself on the bathroom floor? I was really struggling to hold it in, and the exam was about to begin. In the end, I managed to uphold human civilization...

I barely finished both the "Administrative Aptitude Test" and the "Essay Writing" sections. There were simply too many questions, and I couldn't afford to focus greedily on every scoring opportunity. At noon, Xiao Huanhuan ordered a lot of food, but we couldn't finish it all. While I was taking the exam in the afternoon, Xiao Huanhuan visited the Guizhou Provincial Geological Museum.

When Xue Feng found out I was in Guiyang for the exam, he arranged for us to have dinner at his place today. It's rare for the four of us from 1204 to get together, so after the exam, Xiao Huanhuan and I quickly took a taxi to Xue Feng's house.

We ate, drank, and chatted until 11 PM, and I managed to get a relatively quiet night's sleep. On Sunday morning, I woke up early and had breakfast with Xiao Kun and Xiao Xia at the old vegetarian noodle shop on Court Street, along with two portions of sticky rice that caused a bit of a quarrel between Huanhuan and me. Xiao Kun and Xiao Xia also took us out for pasta, and we ended up eating way too much.

After the meal, we headed straight to the North Station by subway to go home. Huanhuan's dad prepared a huge feast, and we ate so much. I bought some milk and watermelon, and the out-of-season fruit tasted especially good when I was craving it.

This morning, after seeing Huanhuan off to work, we had noodles together. Mine was the "Iron Rice Bowl," while hers was the "Executive Special." After eating, I walked to Shengjing Square and finally found a restroom.

Since returning, I've been feeling extremely tired, as if no amount of sleep is enough. I played on my phone for a while and worked on my CSC application materials, but my eyes and head were so uncomfortable that I didn't feel like doing anything. I'll check again tomorrow morning, and if everything's fine, I'll head to Kunming in the afternoon.

Check the train ticket...
