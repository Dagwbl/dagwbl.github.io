Recently, I've been feeling unusually anxious, and it's hard to describe this state.

I’ve already started anticipating the rejection of my CSC application, looking forward to the stability of starting a regular job. At noon, Yao Dong called me to discuss work-related matters and mentioned that Professor Cai is also planning to study abroad, saying that upon returning, he could supervise Ph.D. students. Later, I came across a video by Geng on Bilibili, where he talked about wanting to pursue a Ph.D. in his 50s. I think it’s a great idea. The current issue is whether our abilities can support us in leading a relatively stable and smooth life.

Today, I also splurged on buying *Dwarf Fortress*, but the learning curve is so steep that I can barely play it. I also tried *Turing Complete*, only to realize my brain isn’t sharp enough for it.

In the evening, I went out for another walk with my mom. We walked to People’s Square and back, covering a total distance of about 8 kilometers.
