As the weather turns cold, one always feels like burrowing under the covers. The water city truly lives up to its name with an abundance of water, and now the sound of a gentle drizzle is tapping against the window again.

This morning, I spent the entire time working on the annual salary report. When I delivered it in the morning, I was met with a barrage of criticism, and when asked about some unit issues, I was at a loss for words. It seems I'll have to let Sister Nan handle it herself and make a trip.

In the afternoon, I went to the Labor Bureau to submit materials for public welfare positions. The person in charge of receiving the documents wasn't there, so I just left the materials on her desk and came back. I've been thinking about buying a small potted plant for Sister Nan, and across from the Labor Bureau is a flower and bird market. I strolled around the market entrance but didn't find anything particularly attractive or that I wanted to buy. On my way back, I saw someone selling potato skins, bought half a kilo, and then noticed an elderly man buying two pots of flowers. I thought they looked quite nice, so I asked the man where he got them. He pointed me in the direction, and upon entering again, I saw several fresh pots of carnations. I picked one out, haggled the price down from 20 to 15, and settled on 18.

Sister Nan also gave me two novels, which I can read and learn from when I have some free time later. In the evening, I cooked rice and called my brother to come back for dinner. I added a bit too much water, but it was still passable. My brother also bought some braised beef; I fried some potato skins, but they didn't taste very good, far from what my mom and the others make themselves.
