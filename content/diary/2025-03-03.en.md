This morning, as soon as I got up, Sister Nan sent me a message asking if I was going to work today. I said yes, and Sister Nan immediately sent me a list of work assignments, so naturally, my morning was gone.

In the afternoon, the Organization Department came over for a survey and requisitioned the office of the Personnel and Education Section. As a result, I didn't do anything all afternoon and just sat in the courtyard of the Transportation Bureau reading an e-book for a while. 

It suddenly started raining, so I went back to the office to see if they had finished. I ran into Section Chief Yang, who told me to just go ahead and clock out.
