Yesterday the groceries I bought arrived. Today is Chinese New Year,and honestly, 400 RMB barely buys anything. I had salmon, Chinese chives, and roasted pork ribs. Since I'm spending the New Year alone, I thought I'd at least make something nice for myself.

While I was cooking, I called a few friends. Yuanbo even sent me a 500 RMB red envelope, that's real love!

Huan had some conflict with her family today, but I believe she'll handle it well.
