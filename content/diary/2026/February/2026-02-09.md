Group-meeting again, #Jian didn't nominate me to be the #host. They were so kind to me, but I felt a little bit bad. Actually, I don't mind being the host, though I'm a little bit shy and worried about my English. 

There will be a quiz tomorrow, so today I spent a lot of time reviewing the materials. I hope I can do well in the quiz.

Jain said he would have an #experiment for me in summer, which is from the industry. So I can get some money from it. That's good news. I hope I can do well in the experiment and get some money.


I also grabbed a cup of coffee with my classmate; I hope I can sleep well tonight, don't get insomnia again.
