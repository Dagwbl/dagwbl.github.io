### 🕒 15:00 | Optimized Obsidian Startup Speed

By disabling some plugins and delaying the startup of others, I successfully improved the startup speed of #Obsidian on my phone.

### 🕒 15:04 | Tinkering with Vim

I downloaded the nightly version of #Wezterm , and my terminal can now display images! However, there are still some minor issues affecting my #neovim workflow. At this point, one of the biggest reasons I want to buy a #MacBook is to have a perfect terminal environment for writing and note-taking.

### 🥾 Bought a Pair of Work Shoes

For safety reasons, we are required to have a pair of CSA-certified safety shoes.

Amir asked me to go shoe shopping last Thursday, but I didn't want to spend a workday shopping. He mentioned that if I went today at 2 PM, he could join me. Around 2 PM, I received a message from him asking to push it back to 3 PM. I didn't believe he’d actually be ready by 3 PM, so I told him I was going ahead without him. He then asked if I could just buy a size 8 for him, but since I also needed to get groceries, I declined.

This was the first time I asked for a student discount, and I got 10% off! Not bad at all.

### 🚶 Walked Home

Since I missed the bus, I decided to walk home. I stopped at Safeway on the way to buy some eggs and chicken 🍗.

I was feeling so hungry that I broiled all of the chicken and made a stir-fry with melon and pork. Hot meals always recharge my energy.

### 🛠️ Chezmoi and Wezterm

Today I tried Neovide, a GUI for #neovim. I really like its smooth animations. However, after trying the nightly #Wezterm and seeing that it supports image display, I gave up on Neovide immediately. That feature is a game-changer for me.
