What I did do today?

I said some #dirty words to Huan when I woke up. And then went to school to study and preview *Rock mechanics*. Near the end of getting off work. I tried to do the assignment of MIN E 630.

Chat and I grabbed a cup of coffee in the morning, mine is black. I am already used to drinking black coffee.

I decided to join Chat for exercising in gym tomorrow morning.
