I spent the day working on my assignments. #Chathuranga provided some helpful guidance on how to approach the term paper, which gave us a clearer direction. However, by 4:00 PM, I felt like I had hit a limit and couldn't absorb any more information. I decided to call it a day and headed home at 4:30 PM.

Lately, I’ve been feeling quite down about everything. I’ve realized that I should probably start keeping these thoughts to myself more often; repeating them too frequently might lead to unnecessary conflict or trouble with those around me.

For now, I will and only can just let things take their course.
