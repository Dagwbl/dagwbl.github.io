#Huan said that she isn't interested in taking the English exam.

I spent the day working on my assignments. #Chathuranga provided some helpful guidance on how to approach the term paper, which gave us a clearer direction. However, by 4:00 PM, I felt like I had hit a limit and couldn't absorb any more information. I decided to call it a day and headed home at 4:30 PM.

Lately, I’ve been feeling quite down about everything. I’ve realized that I should probably start keeping these thoughts to myself more often; repeating them too frequently might lead to unnecessary conflict or trouble with those around me.

For now, I will and only can just let things take their course.

There are a series of questions coming to my mind, but I’m not sure if I want to answer them right now. I’m not even sure if I want to ask them at all. Maybe it’s better to just let them be for now and see how things unfold.

1. Would farmers like farming? Like muddy soil? Dirty organic fertilizer? Should one shed one's own sweat on this land? I only know that they will be happy when killing the pig near New Year's Eve.
2. Are two people who are unwilling to plan their future together truly in love?
3. How to manage our everyday life? What I mean is the time.
