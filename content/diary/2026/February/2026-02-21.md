今天的日记想骂两个今天晚上在地铁上遇到的一对狗男女。滑雪结束人直接累摊了，一点能量都没有。地铁对面坐了一男一女，两个人似是流浪汉的打扮，男的是个金毛，满是泥垢的破洞裤子和像是穿了半年的蓝灰格子衬衣，女的要稍微干净些，没大注意穿搭细节，只注意到打着鼻环，皮衣皮裤还是啥的。我坐在对面望着窗子发呆。突然那个金毛问我在看啥，说我在瞪人，意图想要撵我走开。可我没有理他们，继续坐在那儿，玩着我的手机。不几秒钟，他们就开始做着苟且事情，亲起嘴来了。晚上牛鬼蛇神实在是多，以后晚上还是尽量避免出来和陌生人打交道了。

内心想了很多报复的计划，如果我有枪？如果我骂回去？如果警察过来举报他们逃票？这些都没有达成，纠缠于他们只会惹得一身骚。异国他乡的，还是平安就好。

今天滑雪实在是累，加上昨天健身练了上半身的缘故。结束的时候没有一点点能量了，浑身痛得要命。Luis他们都很开心，还想下周六继续来，可是我的屁股不允许了。

昨天又让小欢欢熬夜没睡好了，因为质疑她有事情瞒着我。谎言在爱情中像会蔓延的毒药一样，有些时候得刮骨剃肉才能重新好起来。

Today’s diary entry is just to vent about a disgusting couple I ran into on the subway tonight.

After skiing, I was completely drained — absolutely no energy left. Sitting across from me on the train was a man and a woman who looked almost like they were homeless. The guy was blond, wearing filthy ripped jeans and a blue-gray plaid shirt that looked like he had been wearing it for half a year straight. The woman was slightly cleaner. I didn’t pay much attention to her outfit, only noticed she had a nose ring and was dressed in what seemed like leather.

I was sitting there staring blankly at the window. Suddenly the blond guy asked what I was looking at and said I was staring at them, clearly trying to intimidate me and make me move away. I ignored them and kept sitting there, scrolling on my phone.

Within seconds, they started making out right there.

At night, all kinds of strange people seem to come out. I should really try to avoid going out late and interacting with strangers in the future.

I had all kinds of revenge fantasies running through my head — what if I had a gun? What if I yelled back at them? What if I reported them for fare evasion and the police showed up? None of that happened. Getting entangled with people like that would only drag me into trouble. In a foreign country, staying safe is what matters most.

Skiing today was exhausting, especially since I trained upper body at the gym yesterday. By the end, I had absolutely nothing left in me. My whole body aches. Luis and the others were all very happy and already want to go again next Saturday — but my butt definitely does not approve.

Yesterday I also made Xiaohuan stay up late again because I suspected she was hiding something from me. Lies in a relationship spread like poison; sometimes it feels like you have to cut deep to heal properly.
