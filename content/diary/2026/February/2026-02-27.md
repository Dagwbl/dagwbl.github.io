I slept well last night, easily fell asleep and didn't wake up early, which meant I only can drink small size #coffee from now on. But it's good for me to save a little bit money. I also went to the gym for exercising with Chathuranga this morning.

I finished and submitted the homework 6 of FEM today; didn't do other things. I wanna spend some time on term paper this weekend.

I also spent much time on tinkering #LazyVim.
