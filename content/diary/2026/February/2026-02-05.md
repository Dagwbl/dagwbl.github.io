I suffered from terrible insomnia last night.

By 7 AM, I simply couldn't endure the frustration of not sleeping anymore, so I decided to get up and start my day.

I had three lectures again today. I feel exhausted, though surprisingly, I’m not quite as tired as I expected to be.

After school, I came home and managed to get a two-hour nap. I’m starting to think that the coffee I drank yesterday at noon was the culprit behind my insomnia.

I really need to head to bed now.
