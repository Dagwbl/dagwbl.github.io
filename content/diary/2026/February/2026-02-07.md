I got 50 Yuan from Huan for buying my yesterday's diary. I hope she can come Canada for learning, for accompanying, whatever. Anyway, I hope we can live together, and we can experience the same life, and take care of each other.

I went to EPL to have a look and try to study for a while. Finally, I loaned a book named *Bury the lead*.

Didn't  do too much today.
