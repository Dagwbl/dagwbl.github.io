忘记记录了今天。

今天四点就早早醒来了，七点早早的起床，手忙脚乱的洗漱，收拾东西，准备午餐。

去和Chathuranga健身了，早上写了作业，下午开始着手termpaper的撰写。

晚上和Jian去west edmonton mall 逛了逛，还在T&T 吃了饭，不大好吃，但是可贵了。

回到家人已累瘫。



I forgot to record today.

My day started incredibly early—I woke up at 4:00 AM and finally got out of bed at 7:00 AM. It was a frantic morning of washing up, packing my things, and prepping my lunch.

I went to the gym with Chathuranga for a workout, which felt good. I spent the morning working on my assignments, and in the afternoon, I officially started writing my term paper.

In the evening, Jian and I went to West Edmonton Mall. We had dinner at the T&T Supermarket food court; honestly, the food wasn't that great, and it was surprisingly expensive.

By the time I got home, I was completely wiped out.
