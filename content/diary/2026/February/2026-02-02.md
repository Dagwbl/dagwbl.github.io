I’ve realized that I shouldn't share too many personal details during group meetings. Sometimes professors might misunderstand you or even form negative impressions. From now on, I plan to stick strictly to reporting the facts.

I finally finished an assignment for my Finite Element Method (FEM) course. However, I fell into the trap of tinkering with my editor and software again until 5 PM. It’s a habit I really need to break, as it consumes too much of my productive time.

In the evening, I braised some pork ribs with yam and lotus root for tomorrow’s lunch. Afterward, I spent about an hour scrolling on my phone before calling it a night.
