#Chathuranga had a experiment today, so he wanted to grab this chance to guide us to do some lab works. He is always thoughtful. I believe that Amir and I leaned something useful today.

After lab works, so sleepy and tired. I crawled on the table and rested for a while. And I also finished the second #homework of MINE 620. And tried to review some FEM content for preparing the quiz next week.

At night I had grilled pork ribs and braised pork ribs for dinner again. Just wanna get some sleep quickly.
