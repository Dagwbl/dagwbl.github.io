Woke up early today. I couldn't continue sleep after 5 am, so I got up at 7 am, quickly washed up. I had a #argument with #Huan because I thought she accidently turn on the mute function when we were calling.

And then, I first time went to the gym for #fitness with Chat.

Hate Thursday again, FEM, Rock mechanics, Mine.

How tired a day.
