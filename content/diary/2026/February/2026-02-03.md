So tired now.

Took 2 courses today, and finished the homework 2 of MINE 530.

During my back home, I felt hungry to picnic again, so I quickly made some food for dinner when I got home.

The Chinese New Year is coming, and I think I need to buy some gifts for my family members, especially for these kids.

Thus, I bought a astronomical telescope for more than 600 RMB, and another normal telescope, for those little baby. I also want to buy a excavator toy for Baby Yu. It seems that I wanna treat them just like the kid who I used to be.

I still remember I promised Huan to buy a Polaroid camera for her, but I always choose to wait and wait. Gradually, I treat her as myself, become frugal to ourselves.
