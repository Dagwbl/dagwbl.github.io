I forgot today is still holiday for me, because Victor said we can have a day off for Chinese New Year.

When Chathuranga messaged me,"Are you coming to campus today? No right?" I replied, "Yes I will".  Actually, I need to finish the assignment 5 of FEM, Feb 19 is the deadline.

It's was a nice day, though the snowstorm is so heavy. The snow was flying horizontally directly.

Luis also came to the office today, we had lunch together. He have never seen the Chinese Nuts before, I shared a few of that with him. After that, we decided to go skiing this staturday.

I also found something that fun but not very moral -- The Chinese guy who is very social to me, is worse than me in English speaking. I first time felt how was I in other perspectives when I was speaking English.

Unconsciously, my English is gradually making progress slowly, like I said before.
