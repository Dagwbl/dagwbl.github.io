I had two classes and received the results of the Rock Mechanics midterm. I got 100. #Amir got 95 and told me about his score, but I didn’t really respond. I don’t care much about these results — as long as I pass, that’s enough for me.

I’ve been working on the proposal for the FEM term paper. Sometimes I wonder whether constantly tinkering with these tools is a good thing. But I think I genuinely enjoy it. If I have the time, I’m willing to keep doing it.

Because I tinkered the completion for literature in LazyVim, I stayed up too late last night, and I didn't write today's journal.

Feb 24, I got two classes and receieved the results of mid-term of Rock Mechanics. I got 100 marks, but I didn't talk to Amir, even he got 95 marks and told to me. I don't care about these results, just passing is ok.

I have been writing a proposal for term paper of FEM. I don't know continuously tinkering these tool is good or not? But I think I like it, if I have time, I'm willing to do it.
