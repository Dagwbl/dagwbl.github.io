I used that damn promotion on [yesterday](./2026-02-19.md)! I got an iced tea from KFC, but it gave me #insomnia and I couldn't sleep until midnight. To make things worse, I woke up at 5:30 am, which is really bad for me.

Despite feeling tired, I still decided to go to the #gym with Chathuranga this morning. After the gym, Jian, Chathuranga, and I grabbed some coffee from Tim Hortons. I was feeling energyless today and didn't accomplish much at the office.

I continued to configure my #Lazyvim for the whole evening after I got back home. It's really good now. I configured a writing mode for creating long texts or documents.

I'm always so excited to tinker with these things, otherwise I'd be asleep by now. But I need to control myself to avoid sleep too early or too late, otherwise I'll wake up too early and feel tired the next day.
