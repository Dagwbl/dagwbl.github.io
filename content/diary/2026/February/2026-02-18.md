Woke up so early again. I woke up at 5 am and had a pee this morning. And then I couldn't fall asleep any more, as usual.

Quickly washing up and preparing lunch. I arrived at the office at 8 pm, and searched some bears. I met Bonnie when I was searching the bears. She told me have a fun.

After that, I went to go the gym for #fitness with Chathuranga. Workout is hard for me, and I even couldn't control my muscles, especially the muscles on my leg.

I really like the reading week, no class. I can focus on what I want to do.

Huan came to my home, I hope she can get some fun and relaxing.

I can use #Neovim to finish a lots of things now.
