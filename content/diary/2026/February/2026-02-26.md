I think I’m gradually getting used to working out now. I don’t feel much soreness after exercising anymore.

Crazy Thursday again, but I felt much better than before because I slept well last night. I fell asleep easily and didn’t wake up at all until my alarm pulled me out of my dream. The small size #coffee is helpful and no much more effects on sleep.

So overall, it was a good day.

I like Apel Derek’s class. He always gives us technical demonstrations or practical examples so we can connect with real-world applications. The class is very engaging. Recently, I’ve also learned a lot from Victor’s class, although I can still feel that he has been quite tired.

Today I attended a Canadian Institute of Mining event that cost 10 dollars. It was really helpful and meaningful. It helped me understand what people in the industry are actually doing. I also felt more confident — I realized that I can do this too, maybe even better.

There was a funny moment. I noticed a guy standing in front of a poster about IoT in mining transportation, so I asked him a few questions. He told me the project was done by his colleague and then he left. Soon after, some other people came over and started asking questions, and somehow I ended up becoming the #presenter.

Chathuranga and Amir found it hilarious. Otherwise, they would probably have been bored at the event.

I also took a box of food to go, and later I gave it to #Zhiqiang when I met him at the university train station.

I think I am gradually used to do the workout now. I don't feel much painful after exercise.

Crazy Thursday again, I fell more better than before, because the sleep quality last night was not bad. I easily fell asleep and didn't wake up during the whole night till my alarm disturb me from the dream.

So, it's a good day! I like the Apel Derek's class, he always gave us some technical demo or sample to let us contact the real things. We were so interesting in his class. And recently, I also learned a lot form Victor's class, though I can still feel he have been being tired.

I attended the Canadian Institution of Mining event today for 10 dollars. It's really helpful and meaningful. Let me knew what are they doing? I found more confidence, I still can do that, even better than them. There was a funny thing, I noticed that a guy, who stand in front of a poster about IoT in mining transportation. I asked some question to that guy, and he said this was made by his colleague, then he left. Next to, there were some people approached me, and then I become the presenter.

This thing gave Chathuranga and Amir a lot of fun, otherwise they felt so boring there.

I also took a box of food to go, and I gave it to Zhiqiang when I met him at the university train station.
