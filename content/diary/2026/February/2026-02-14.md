I didn't get anything done today. After waking up and calling Huan this morning, I found I couldn't fall back asleep.

I spent some time doing some grocery shopping; I ordered some items from T&T Supermarket and then headed out to Safeway to pick up some treats, including some salmon, bananas, and a small cake.

Buy some groceries to prepare for the Chinese New Year, and eat something that I usually feel expensive and reluctant to eat alone
