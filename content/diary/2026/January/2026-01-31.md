### 01:04 Get insomnia again

I want to have a good relaxing.

### 08:36 Woke up early

Not only did I not sleep well, I also woke up very early. I felt groggy all day, didn't want to do anything, and couldn't fall asleep even though I wanted to.

### 12:47 Conflict with Huan

I wanted to continue sleeping more, but I can't fall asleep.I got up and quickly made myself something to eat.Huan and I had a fight last night. Every time we argue, it drains our energy.

I played games for over an hour this afternoon, but I didn't feel any joy.Utterly disappointed, I uninstalled the game. I had a pent-up emotion I wanted to release, but I didn't know how. So I slapped myself hard twice.

That evening, I told Huanhuan about a possible solution.Perhaps we can reduce communication, especially voice or video communication.This is too easy to cause conflict.

The crucial point is to prioritize our sleep.
