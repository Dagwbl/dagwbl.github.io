Last night I had an argument with Huan again. I reflected on myself and realized that my temper isn’t very good, and at the same time I blamed her for always staying silent and not expressing her own opinions.

Today, I feel that my English is really quite poor. My progress has been very slow, and I still have trouble communicating with others when it comes to complex issues.

Today, Luis asked Amir and me to go to a job fair. I had absolutely no interest in it, and I also didn’t have the courage to take the initiative to talk to people and learn more. I felt extremely frustrated.

Learning English has become urgent. My vocabulary seems insufficient, and I need to take the initiative to memorize more words. I also need to make good use of my time to review grammar once again.

By the way, at lunchtime today, Luis wanted to eat with us and asked whether I wanted to try his food. I rejected him instinctively. In the evening, I felt really bad about it, so I sent him a [text message](../../../letter/letter_202601072109.md) to explain.

昨晚又和小欢欢吵架了，反思自己脾气总是不大好，也责怪她总是沉默不表达自己意见。

感觉自己的英语实在是太差劲了，进步非常的慢，和别人进行复杂问题的沟通依然还是存在问题。

今天 Luis 叫我和 Amir 去招聘会，我压根对那些不感兴趣，也没有勇气去主动开口了解，感到非常的挫败。

英语的学习刻不容缓，词汇量似乎也不够，需要主动的去背更多的单词了。赶紧抓紧时间再把语法再过一遍。

对了，今天中午 Luis 想和我们一起吃饭，他问我想不想尝他的，我下意识地拒绝了。晚上感觉非常不好，于是发了[短信](../../../letter/letter_202601072109.md) 给他解释。
