I **didn't sleep well** last night because I was preoccupied with the thought of going to talk to Dr. Liu. I wasn't quite sure what to say, but I was **genuinely worried** about him.

At noon, I had lunch with Dr. Zhao, Luis, and Amir. The **turkey I roasted yesterday** was actually quite delicious, so I brought some along to share with them.

In the afternoon, I had a long, **heart-to-heart talk** with Dr. Liu. I was able to express my care and share my thoughts with him. Overall, it went very well, though I have this habit of **tearing up** whenever I sense someone else’s strong emotions. It’s a bit frustrating that I react that way, but the connection was real.

In the evening, I called Huan and then spent some time **on the phone with my family**.

昨晚没睡好，因为想着要去找刘老师聊天。不知道说些啥，但是我有点担心他。

中午和赵师兄，Luis 和 amir 一起吃饭。我昨天做的火鸡还挺香的，给他们带了些。

下午和刘老师聊了非常多，也表明了我的关心和想法。总体来说还是挺好的，就是我一感觉到别人的情绪就老是会掉眼泪。这点还是挺烦的。

晚上给小欢欢打电话，然后又和家里打电话。
