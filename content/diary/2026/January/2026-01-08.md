## English

There is so much worth recording today. Since it’s getting late, I’ll write this down now and keep it for my records.

First, my **English-related anxiety** eased up significantly today, especially after attending classes with Derek and Victor. I was amazed to find that I could understand **nearly 90% of the content**; the remaining 10% didn't hinder my overall comprehension at all. My confidence in English is finally coming back.

Another thing I noticed during class was that Victor seemed **exhausted and low on energy**. I really want him to feel better, so I’m planning to gather my courage and stop by his office tomorrow just to **chat for a bit**. I realized that many people need care and connection. In their own worlds, they might be bogged down by trivial, stressful matters and simply need a chance to **relax and talk**.

In the evening, Huan forwarded me a photo of He You that Xiao Xue had sent. It occurred to me that I hadn't talked to them in a long time, so I spent some time **chatting and joking** with them in our group chat. Those old days were so happy, especially during my first two years of university. Here, there isn't such affordable hotpot, cheap alcohol, or **friendships that feel quite that pure**.

Things that seem difficult can lead to **surprising changes** if you just persist day by day. Whether it’s for a dream, a passion, or the future, it is worth sticking with the things that might cause short-term struggle but lead to long-term growth.

## Chinese

今天有很多值得记录的事情。因为时间太晚了，就直接用中文记录吧，明天再翻译成英文。

第一就是今天的英语焦虑好了一些，尤其是上完 Derek 和 victor 的课之后。惊叹自己能够听懂几乎 90%的内容，而其他的内容已经不能够影响理解。英语自信又回来许多。

另一个就是在上课的时候，发现 victor 总是感觉很累，感觉很缺少能量的样子。我希望他开心一些，所以我打算明天鼓起勇气去他办公室里闲聊一会儿。突然发现很多人都需要别人的关心，他们在自己的世界里面可能会被各种各样琐碎烦心的事情困扰，他们需要放松和倾诉。

晚上小欢欢给我转发了小雪发的何优的照片，想着很久没有找他们聊天了。于是在群里和他们吹了会儿牛，以前的时光可真快乐啊，尤其是大一大二大时候。这边没有那么便宜的火锅，没有那么便宜的酒，也没有那么纯粹的朋友了。

看似很难的事情，一点一点的坚持，突然会在某一天发现有惊喜的改变。对于梦想，对于热爱，对于未来，都应该去坚持做一些短期会让自己痛苦的事情。
