Following my conversation with Victor last Friday, I decided to start **getting up early**.

I was out the door by 9 AM and spent the morning working on **Assignment 1 for my Finite Element Method (FEM) course**.

As usual, we had our **group meeting at 1 PM** with Victor, Jason, Kourosh, and me. At the end of the meeting, Victor asked to have a **one-on-one session** with me at 4 PM.

The weather lately has been **wonderful and mild**, making it feel as though **spring is just around the corner**.

During our meeting, Victor took the time to learn more about my **academic background** and shared some of his thoughts. While we didn't land on a **substantive research topic** yet, it was a positive step toward **defining my research goals**.

I finally finished and **submitted the assignment** at midnight.

On a sad note, I **lost my favorite wooden spoon** today. I'm actually quite upset about it.
