### 00:21 Getting ready for bed

I feel a muscle twitching or something moving in my stomach every now and then; it’s distracting and making it hard to fall asleep.

Opened Pinduoduo to help my dad look for the Amur Cork Tree (_Phellodendron amurense_) he wants to buy.

### 00:24 Perfect

Using my phone for daily snippets; my computer or tablet for the end-of-day review; and my computer for note-taking or articles.

Everything is organized into Obsidian very conveniently.

Woke up quite early today. After waking up, I had a video call with Huan. I taught her how to use the online resources for _English Grammar in Use_.

Then, I had a release under Huan's help.

### 13:50 Turkey legs are terrible

Extremely gamey—so disgusting it makes me want to gag.

### 16:26 Heading out

Went to the supermarket to buy meat, milk, and veggies, then hit the liquor store for some beer. Alcohol is so expensive here; I can barely afford it.

School starts tomorrow, but I haven't accomplished much over the break. I'm feeling a bit guilty.
