I didn’t sleep well last night and didn’t fall asleep until almost two o’clock. I was exhausted the entire day today.

On top of that, I had classes all day today. Three classes were truly draining.

In the morning and again in the evening, Xiaohuan and I got into some confusing arguments over things that didn’t really make sense. Perhaps we both need to read more, experience more, and feel more.

昨晚没睡好，快两点才睡着，今天一整天可困了。

而且今天有一整天的课程，三节课是真的累。

早上和晚上都和小欢欢因为一些摸不着头脑的争论而摸不着头脑。或许我们都应该去阅读更多，经历更多，感受更多。
