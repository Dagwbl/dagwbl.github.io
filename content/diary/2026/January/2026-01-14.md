I didn't sleep very well last night, so I felt quite **groggy** when I woke up today.

Despite the tiredness, it was a very **fulfilling day** of study. I spent the entire day reading literature and recorded my thoughts and to-do items in my **weekly log** ([2026-W03](../weekly/2026-W03.md)). I also managed to submit my assignments. In the morning, I grabbed a coffee with Dr. Zhao. During lunch with Luis, Amir, and Dr. Zhao, we ran into Zheng, and I introduced everyone. Without realizing it, I’ve once again become the **central hub** and a **bridge** for connecting different people in the group.

For dinner, I made some vegetables in a **sour broth** (Suantang), which was delicious. Afterward, I started working on some code to implement an **all-in-one workflow** for my assignments using **Quarto**.

On a side note, I found a discarded chair near the garbage station this morning and decided to **salvage** it. Also, after seeing that my roommate had left the bathroom messy again, I finally hit my limit and **sent him a message** to address the issue.

昨晚睡得不是特别好，今天起床困困的。

今天学习比较充实，看了一整天的文献,写了一些想法和代办在 [2026-W03](../weekly/2026-W03.md)，然后把作业提交了。早上和 Dr Zhao 去买了杯咖啡。中午和 Luis Amir, Zhao 一起吃饭，碰到政，介绍了他们一起认识。不知不觉，我又变成了大家的中心和认识其他人的桥梁。

晚上回家酸汤煮了蔬菜，非常好吃。然后开始写代码实现作业在 quarto 里面的一站式完成。

对了，早上出门在垃圾站旁边捡了个椅子。晚上看到室友又把卫生间弄脏了，终于忍不住和他发消息说了。
