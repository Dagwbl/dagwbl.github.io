Today marked the start of the winter semester, and with it, the return to a tense and busy academic life.

We had a small group meeting at noon with Dr. Liu serving as today's chair. We shared stories about our holidays and discussed our resolutions for the new year.

I shared my four main goals for the year:

1. To continue improving my English and become a more confident speaker.
2. To learn the ropes of academic research and strive to complete one or two first drafts by the end of the year.
3. To travel to another Canadian province.
4. To save up enough money to buy a new laptop.

In the afternoon, Dr. Zhao invited me to his office to discuss my future plans. He suggested two research directions: RFID technology and concrete energy storage. Both sound fascinating to me. I need to start carving out time to read the literature and learn as much as possible from the senior students (my _shixiong_) while they are still here.

Later, Amir and I attended the orientation for new winter intake students. We were pleasantly surprised to find that they provided a complimentary meal!

However, I realized once again that I truly dislike social settings where you have to sit and chat with strangers—even with other Chinese students. It might just be my personality; I simply don't have much desire to dive into other people's lives.

今天冬季学期开始了，又要开始紧张忙碌的学习生活了。

中午开会人不多，Dr. Liu 作为今天的主席。分享了各自的假日，以及对今年的计划。

我分享了我的四个计划：
1. 继续学习英语，更加自信的说英语
2. 学习了解如何做科研，争取年底写出 1 至两篇初稿
3. 去到加拿大另外一个州旅行
4. 攒钱买一台笔记本电脑

下午的时候，Dr. Zhao 叫我去他的办公室谈了谈我未来的打算。给我建议了两个方向，一个 RFID 和混凝土储能。我觉得都非常好，我也要开始抽时间开始阅读文献了。趁着师兄他们还在赶紧多向他们学习。

回来后和 Amir 一起去了冬季入学新生的 orientation，后面才发现有提供餐食。

我真是打心眼里不喜欢这种和陌生的人坐一起聊天的场合，那怕和中国人也不愿意。这或许是我的性格使然，我不想了解别人。
