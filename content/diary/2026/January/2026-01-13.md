I don’t know why some things are so **energy-consuming**, especially tasks like writing in my journal or studying.

My day mostly consisted of **attending two classes** and working on my **Rock Mechanics homework**.

Aside from that, it was a quiet day with **nothing major to report**.

In addition, I called the RBC to get $6 refund.
