Chathuranga is back and brought us gifts - fridge magnets and jasmine tea. Very nice. We had lunch together at noon.

Our regular group meeting at noon was uneventful. Started learning about Typst and FEM, then began studying VIM. After dinner at home, continued learning VIM. This editor is incredibly difficult to use.
