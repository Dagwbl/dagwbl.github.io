Gemini gave me some great advice while I was learning **Neovim**. It made a very good point:

### 13:33 "For beginners, 'over-intelligent' tools are often the biggest obstacle to learning."

Since I am using a "cleaned-up" tutorial, I shouldn't obsess over the missing 'X' in the exercise. The core purpose of Lesson 1.4 is simply to learn how to use `i` to append missing characters. As long as I identify where a line is missing text and manually complete it, I’ve achieved the goal of the exercise.

### Afternoon

I headed to the **Edmonton Public Library (EPL)** before sunset. The library is beautiful, though it was actually a bit crowded. I definitely plan to spend more time there in the future.

After leaving the library, I dropped by the **bun shop** next door. I picked up a box of buns but momentarily **forgot to pay**. The cashier got **very angry with me**, even though I had only just turned around and hadn't even taken a single step away. I apologized to her, but I really didn't appreciate her attitude.

I suspect that similar things must have happened to her before, which might explain why she reacted so poorly.
