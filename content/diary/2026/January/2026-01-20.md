I had two classes today that went until 2 PM. I was extremely tired all day because I didn't sleep well.

At lunch, I thought about eating early since I had class soon. I mentioned this to Chathuranga, and he said he wanted to eat now too. Well, that made our group too big and we couldn't all sit together. It was pretty awkward.
