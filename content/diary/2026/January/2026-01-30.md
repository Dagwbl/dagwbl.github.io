It was a relatively quiet Friday. I am starting to adapt to reading literature in the afternoon. I am not satisfied to the assignments Victor assigned—the questions seem vague and unclear.

Additionally, I’m finding it a bit irritating that Amir constantly asks me questions like, "What happened?" "What’s going on?" or "Did Dr. Liu come by the office?" I simply don't have the time or the concentration to deal with messages that don't concern me. Honestly, I don't think those things should be important to him, either.

I had a big dinner and spent the rest of the night studying [Lazyvim for Ambitious Developers](https://lazyvim-ambitious-devs.phillips.codes/). While I worked, I also had a video call with Huan.
