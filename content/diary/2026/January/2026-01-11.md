Once again, I didn't get anything productive done today. I had planned to wake up early to study, but I kept telling myself to sleep a little longer. When I couldn't fall back asleep, I ended up **scrolling on my phone** instead.

After lunch, I did some chores—showering, washing my dirty clothes and socks, and prepping my lunch for tomorrow. Just like that, the day passed by in a **haze**.

I was shocked to see that my **screen time** today reached a staggering **9 hours and 37 minutes**.

On another note, I realized that Huan and I share a common weakness: we are **too honest**. I find it impossible to keep anything to myself, though Huan is slightly better at it than I am.

I think I need to work on being a bit more **evasive** and developing the ability to **tell a white lie** when necessary.

今天又是啥都没干，想着早点起来学习。结果想着多睡一会，睡不着又开始玩手机。

中午吃完饭后，洗了澡，洗了脏衣服，脏袜子。做完明天的午餐，今天就这样又浑浑噩噩地过去了。

今天玩手机的时长达到了惊人的 9 小时 37 分钟。

对了，我和小欢欢都又个共同的缺点，那就是太老实了。心里藏不住一点话，小欢欢还是能藏一些。

需要加强一下拐弯抹角的能力和撒谎的能力了。
