**There are so many things to do** that I suddenly feel panicked and don't know where to start.

1. Practice spoken English and writing.
2. Preview upcoming course content and review parts of past courses I didn’t fully understand.
3. Start reading literature and determine my research direction.

It's time to **start using my to-do app again**; only self-discipline can solve these problems.

I studied phonetic symbols and practiced shadowing tonight. It’s hard to pronounce sounds that don't exist in Chinese unless we **build muscle memory** through practice.

要做的事情太多，突然慌了神不知道要要做啥。
1. 要学英语口语，要学习写作
2. 要预习课程内容，要复习上课没看懂的
3. 要准备开始读文献，确定研究方向
是时候又继续每天把代办软件利用起来了，唯有自律才能解决这些事情。

今天晚上学习了音标，练了练跟读。还是要多练习形成肌肉记忆，不然中文没有的音基本不可能流畅的说出口。
