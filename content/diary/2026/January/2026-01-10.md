I was on the phone with Huan this morning until almost 11:00 AM. Afterward, Dr. Zhao asked me to go **grocery shopping** with him so we could head back to his place to cook.

As usual, we **wandered around the mall** for a bit and ended up having Mexican food again. Honestly, it **wasn't very good**.

Later, Dr. Zhao prepared a **huge spread of dishes** and invited two other friends over. After dinner, they were getting ready to watch a movie, but I decided to **head home early**. I wanted to make a few phone calls and **get some rest**.

今天早上给欢欢打电话，打到了早上快十一点，师兄叫我今天和他去买些菜。然后去他家做饭吃。

照例逛了逛商场，又再一次吃墨西哥饭。并不好吃。

然后师兄做了一大桌子菜，还邀请了他另外两个朋友。饭后他们准备看电影，我准备先回来了了。打打电话，早点休息。
