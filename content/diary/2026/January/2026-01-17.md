Today is Saturday. I **woke up early** to video call Huan before she went to bed. I **scolded her** a bit again because I feel she often **represses her emotions** just to be a "good person." I don't think that’s healthy, especially between family and partners—it's important to be honest about how we feel.

After the call, I started working on my assignment. I’ve really come to **enjoy using Quarto and LaTeX** to complete my homework; the results look very professional.

The weather was so beautiful today that I decided to go for a walk. I found a **park bench** and called my parents. My mom mentioned she wanted to take a job planting trees all day for only **60 RMB a day**. I spent a long time trying to **persuade her not to do it**. She has spent her entire life working the soil, and I really want her to finally just **relax and enjoy a peaceful life**.

As it started to get dark, we hung up, and I stopped by **Safeway** to pick up some groceries.

On my way back, a man from **Somalia** struck up a conversation with me. It was a nice interaction, and it made me realize that I should **head to the park or go for walks more frequently** whenever the weather is this nice.
