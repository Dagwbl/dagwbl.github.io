### 10:25 Learning English

I should study English at home rather than in the office, I think. I need to write more journals.

### 14:16 Vimium

Vimium is a browser extension that can make using a browser like Vim.

### 15:58 Safety Training

Finished the Safety Training online course, and then I could start doing the lab soon, hopefully.

### 16:10 About Polishing

Today I learned a very important concept -- about polishing. At the stage of writing, don't worry about the format and the grammar issues.

For every essay I wrote, I should revise and proofread it again.

### EOD

I learn and practice Vim with VSCode extension all night. For me, a tool-lover, I think this is my ultimate end-of-strolling tool.

After mastering it, I think I can pay more attention to content creation.
