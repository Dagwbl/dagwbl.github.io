### 🕒 13:58 | Exhausted

Last night, I scolded Huan again. She mistakenly thought a 12-year-old girl was a single mother; I felt her perception of reality was way off. I made her stay up late again, and now I feel a bit guilty about it.

### 📝 Obsidian & Neovim

I ran into an error with my Obsidian template in Neovim. It took a long time to troubleshoot and fix.

### 🍕 The Buffet Experience

Jian messaged me this afternoon saying he was coming to Southgate Mall to hang out. We decided to grab a box of buns and then head to a buffet.

I definitely overate. For the first five minutes, the food was delicious—I even told Jian it was the best food in Edmonton. However, about fifteen minutes later, the flavors started to feel very "Canadian style": heavy, sweet, and greasy. As soon as I got home, I had to run to the bathroom.

### 📞 Video Call

I had a group call with Kun & Xia, Fang & Quan, and Huan. We just caught up and chatted. We also talked about the passing of Fengxian's grandfather. He was the most important person in her life. I feel terrible for her loss and wish there was more I could do, but I know she is a strong woman and will get through this.
