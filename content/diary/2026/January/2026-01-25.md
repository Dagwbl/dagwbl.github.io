### 🕒 Morning | Time Flies

Time is moving so fast. So far today, I’ve had a video call with **Huan**, spent some time lying in bed **scrolling on my phone**, and played _Honor of Kings_ for an hour.

### 🕒 Afternoon | Tech Troubles

I spent the entire afternoon trying to get my **terminal to support image rendering**, but I failed.

Around 4 PM, I decided to do some laundry. Meanwhile, a **DVD drive** I ordered from Amazon a few days ago arrived. However, it’s **unstable and keeps disconnecting**, so I’ve already applied for a return.

The weekend is **almost over**. On the bright side, I didn't let myself completely spiral into laziness today.

### 🕒 Evening | A Change of Plans

I originally planned to go to **Canada Post** to return the DVD drive, but by the time I got dressed, they were already closed. I also missed my chance to go to **Safeway** for groceries.

Instead of rushing out, I decided to stay in. The **fried pork and potatoes** I made for dinner were very tasty!

I spent some more time studying English, and around 10 PM, I messaged **Alex** to catch up and see how he was doing.
