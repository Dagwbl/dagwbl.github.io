Since I had no classes today, I spent the entire day **working on my assignments**.

In the morning, Luis invited me to a **breakfast event**, but I turned him down. He then called Amir, who suggested that Luis ask me one more time, but I **declined again**.

However, when they returned, Luis **brought a burger back for me**. I felt a bit **guilty and embarrassed** for having said no so many times when he was being so thoughtful. To make up for it, I **shared some meat and an egg** with him during lunch, which made me feel a little better.

In the afternoon, Amir **interrupted me** more than five times within a thirty-minute span. I was starting to get **annoyed**, so I finally said, "Let me focus on my work for a while," and **put on my noise-canceling earphones**. I think he **picked up on my mood** because he didn't speak to me again until 5 PM.
