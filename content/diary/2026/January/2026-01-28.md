### 09:34 Say it again

This song is very warm and soft, I was listening to it during my morning walk.

### 09:45 #Concrete is stone

I wanna find some cutting-edge topic about concrete, perhaps we can see concrete as a stone where we can control the components. Is there any cutting-edge research about how to utilize these stones?

### 13:58 Lab Training

For having the capability to do lab experiments, #Jian gave us another training today. It was about all lab that we might use in the future.

### 14:09 Dont chase novelty for a term paper

I was thinking about writing a term #paper including some novel topics. But I found that it is very hard to find a novel topic, at the same time, I don't have enough time to do some experiments or simulations about the novel topics. So I decided to write a review paper instead.


### 19:24 SSH to Office's Computer

During afternoon, I was getting tired, probably because of the less lunch today. 

I decided to #SSH to my office computer to continue my daytime work from my home after work. It worked well, I can use the termial and VSCode remotely.

It's so nice and so cool!
