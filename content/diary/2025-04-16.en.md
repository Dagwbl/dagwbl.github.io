Human laziness is, to some extent, a manifestation of the law of inertia, and it inherently carries significant friction. A person lying down or at rest finds it difficult to maintain a state of continuous forward motion.

### 00:09 Getting ready for bed

Spent most of today watching educational videos and discovered a highly capable teacher with solid values: [The Right Path in Public Exams is Full of Vicissitudes](https://space.bilibili.com/57658647). I also found his verbatim notes on interviews, which I’ve reposted on my blog: [Verbatim Notes on Interview Insights | The Right Path in Public Exams is Full of Vicissitudes](../posts/note/article_202504162353.md).  

This completely changed my previous perspective—public exams aren’t purely about luck. I used to think that people with similar abilities would perform similarly in exams, and that the benefits of practice might be offset by luck.

The belief that success depends on luck isn't necessarily correct, but we can only explore this after we've done everything within our power to eliminate non-luck factors. If we aspire to achieve great goals, then this is precisely what we must do.
