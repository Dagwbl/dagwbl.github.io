Yesterday, I stayed up late playing games with Huanhuan and didn’t sleep until 3 a.m. Today, I’m exhausted.  

This morning, after getting up, I stir-fried some clams and saved some of them to make clam noodles with the leftover vermicelli from yesterday. The stir-fry turned out pretty good—I’ll definitely make it again in the future.  

The quality of ingredients is the key to whether a dish tastes good or not. I looked it up online and learned that clams can simply be steamed with a bit of cilantro and sesame oil, and they’ll already be delicious. Next time I get fresh clams, I’ll give that a try.  

In the afternoon, I sent Huanhuan home.  

My eyes have been hurting a lot these past few days—I need to cut down on my phone time. I’ve noticed that looking at this phone for even a short while makes me feel really uncomfortable.
