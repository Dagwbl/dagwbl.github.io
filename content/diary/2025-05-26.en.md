### 09:52 Feeling Anxious Again  

In the past, I tended to prepare and arrange daily study plans because I couldn’t go abroad due to financial constraints. But if the CSC scholarship is approved and I can go, things like English proficiency will become extremely important. Some research tools can be temporarily set aside, but I must set aside time every day to study English.  

### 15:08 Check the Vendor’s Overall Appearance Before Buying  

A few days ago, I bought some corn and immediately noticed it wasn’t great, but I had already picked two, so I reluctantly bought them. I also noticed the vendor was selling loquats and bayberries, neither of which looked fresh.  

However, it’s hard to judge the freshness of corn just by looking. Once in Guiyang, I bought some corn and complained that it was too hard. The vendor said, "This kind softens when cooked—it’s actually the best." Skeptical but curious, I bought it, and it turned out surprisingly delicious. When I bought corn this time, I recalled that experience and assumed it was the same type. But today, after cooking it, I realized it wasn’t—it was just old and poor quality.

> When buying groceries, observe the overall quality of the vendor’s goods before deciding whether to purchase. Generally, vendors with a good overall image are less likely to sell subpar items, while those with a poor image are more likely to.

> Especially for items where quality isn’t easily discernible, it’s best to avoid such vendors altogether.  

### 17:22 Went Out for a Walk  

My eyes have been bothering me the past few days. At first, I thought it was due to staring at my phone screen for too long. Gradually, though, I realized my wisdom tooth was inflamed—it seems every time it acts up, my eyes suffer first. I quickly took two metronidazole pills.  

I just went to deliver a folding umbrella to my mom and picked up some mulberries my uncle had picked. I also took a stroll outside. I came across some very fresh corn, bought two, and threw away the three I had bought earlier. Then I found some fresh bayberries—I’d been craving them for days—so I bought half a kilo.

### 22:55 I Think I’ve Lost the Ability to Notice Beauty  

I remember I used to be someone who easily spotted beautiful things in everyday life and was enthusiastic about capturing those little moments with photos.  

But now, I find it hard to notice beauty, and I rarely feel the urge to photograph the lovely things I see.  

Maybe it’s because my surroundings lack beauty these days? Maybe I don’t go out enough to experience life? Or perhaps my inner state has changed? In any case, my phone hasn’t had any new landscape or candid photos in a long time.  

Maybe this is a good thing—maybe I’ve shifted to appreciating life more with my eyes and memory? I don’t really know myself anymore.
