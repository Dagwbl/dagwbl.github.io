### 09:56 Completed Not-By-AI and NonBot Declaration Citations  

Started tinkering with code again—sometimes it's hard to resist the temptation. Especially when I see someone else's great implementation or when a novel idea suddenly pops into my head.  

### 10:14 Ported the Chat Bubble Shortcode  

Inspired by [Some Hugo Shortcodes | Naive Koala](https://www.xalaok.top/post/hugo-shortcodes/#%E8%81%8A%E5%A4%A9%E6%B0%94%E6%B3%A1), the effect is as follows:  

{{< chat position="left" name="Jeapo" timestamp="2025-04-11 09:20">}}  
Little Huanhuan is hungry  
{{< /chat >}}  

{{< chat position="right" name="Huan" timestamp="2025-04-11 09:37" >}}  
The noodles Sister Sha brought, hahaha  
{{< /chat >}}  

{{< chat position="right" name="Huan" timestamp="2025-04-11 09:37" >}}  
So fragrant  
{{< /chat >}}  

From now on, meaningful conversations can be preserved in this format, like the one I had with Manman before: [Is Our Earth Real?](2023/2023-06-22.en.md)  

### 10:55 Hidden Posts  

Some draft-like posts that won’t be edited later, so I added a `hidden` attribute to the site to hide them. Unlike the `draft` attribute, these posts will still be rendered and accessible via direct links. Reference: [Hugo | Adding Hidden Posts Functionality to the Cactus Theme | Little Flying Fish](https://mantyke.icu/posts/2024/hidden-posts/).  

### 12:19 Introduced Heti  

Heti (hè tí) is an open-source project for enhancing Chinese typography, making page layouts more aesthetically pleasing. Project address: [Heti - A Simple and Minimalist Web Chinese Typography Enhancement](https://sivan.github.io/heti/#intro)  

### 13:14 CSC Has Reached the Review Stage at the China Scholarship Council  

Suddenly realized I hadn’t checked the CSC application status in a while—it had been stuck at "Pending Acceptance by the Unit." Just logged in and saw that the provincial education department has approved it, and now it’s under review by the China Scholarship Council.

One step closer to a successful application. Feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness.  

### 14:18 Why Can’t I Keep Things to Myself?  

Couldn’t fall asleep. Kept worrying about my passport still being at my former workplace—it might become an issue.  

### 15:51 Tidied Up the Room  

Living alone really makes me lazy. Huanhuan is coming over this afternoon, so I cleaned up the room a bit—it looks slightly more presentable now.  

### 17:24 Eyes Feeling Sore  

Synced recent diary entries to a notebook.  
Tried adding an info stats page inspired by [Big Little Snail](https://www.eallion.com/stats/), but rendering took too long, so I gave up.  

Time to read for a while.  

### 19:36 2024 Guizhou Provincial Exam Results Are Out  

Saw the results on WeChat—they’re out. I applied for the Guiyang Disabled Persons’ Federation position, and this score basically means no chance for an interview.

### 23:35 Happiness  

For the past four days, I’ve been guiding my mom around the main streets of Shuicheng. Today, to help her practice exploring the city on her own, I asked her to walk along Gongyuan Road to find me. She successfully followed the path and made it to me. We took a short stroll, and she got to know the surrounding streets a little better.  

After dropping my mom off, I walked along the Shuicheng River to pick up Huanhuan.  
Winter is truly over—the cherry blossoms along the riverbank are in full bloom, clustered in thick bunches. Crowds of people gathered beneath them: girls in all kinds of dresses, middle-aged men and women, elderly folks, and children. Shuicheng is coming alive again.  

After meeting Huanhuan, we walked the cherry blossom-lined path once more. It had been a long time since we were alone together, and we both felt relaxed and at ease. The only downside was that I’d walked too much—my lower back was aching terribly.

We took a taxi back from Minghu Road and cooked a bowl of Buldak ramen with crayfish flavor, along with some leftover vegetarian dishes from the morning. It was absolutely delicious—everything was just perfect, even the chilled broth from the vegetables.
