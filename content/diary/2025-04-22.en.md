### 12:13 A fairly focused morning of studying  

Summer has arrived, and the temperature is no longer a major obstacle to getting out of bed. I’ve also been less inclined to laze around in the mornings compared to before.  

Originally, I wanted to find a desktop timer app to help plan study and rest periods. On GitHub, I came across [ClassIsland](https://github.com/ClassIsland/ClassIsland), a project that even includes a class schedule feature, making me feel like I’ve returned to my student days.  

### 15:25 Thoughts  

I strongly agree with what Teacher Zhengdao said:  

> We should not create barriers to knowledge, as doing so will only lead to societal inequity, turning exams into a selection process based on wealth rather than merit.  

### 17:44 Taking a shower  

For humans, taking a shower can, to some extent, be considered a `reset` action. After showering, people tend to feel much more refreshed and comfortable.  

Mom called me again today. When I answered, I said, "What’s up?"  
"Have you cooked and eaten?" she asked.  
"I’m not coming," I replied.  
"I’m asking if you’ve cooked and eaten," she repeated.  
I said no.  
"I bought some ribs today, but no one came for lunch," she added.  
"I’m not coming."  
……  

After reaching an agreement, Mom told me to accept the money Dad had transferred to me yesterday. I said okay.  

I know that accepting it will make them feel better and more at ease.  

### 21:32 Eye discomfort  

I’ve been staring at screens for too long today—almost the entire day watching study videos.  
### 22:16 Why do people feel uneasy in life?  

When we find ourselves in an unfamiliar environment or interacting with unfamiliar people, why do we feel uneasy? I tried to answer this question to help my mom adapt more quickly to her new lifestyle. I asked a few AIs, and the response from ChatGPT-o4-mini best captured the complex logic behind this feeling. Here’s the answer:  

------------  
- **Evolution and Physiological Mechanisms**
    - **"Fear of the Unknown" Instinct**: From an evolutionary perspective, unfamiliar environments or objects may conceal dangers (predators, natural disasters, etc.). The brain automatically labels the "unfamiliar" as a potential threat, activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, releasing cortisol and adrenaline, and triggering a stress response that makes people alert and uneasy.  
- **Cognitive Load and Uncertainty**  
    - **Lack of Pre-existing "Scripts"**: In daily life, we rely on past experiences to quickly invoke "social scripts" (how to greet, how to maintain a conversation, etc.). In unfamiliar settings, there are no ready-made scripts to follow, forcing the brain to expend extra cognitive resources to observe, judge, and decide, leading to fatigue and anxiety.  
    - **Increased Uncertainty**: Not knowing the preferences of others or the rules of the situation, nor the consequences of one’s actions, amplifies tension.  
- **Social Psychology and Self-Evaluation**  
    - **Fear of Negative Judgment**: When interacting with unfamiliar people, individuals often worry that their words or actions will be met with disapproval, rejection, or ridicule. This "social anxiety" further magnifies feelings of unease.  
    - **Reduced Self-Efficacy**: When one feels unable to control the situation, their sense of security wavers, making them more prone to tension and discomfort.  
- **Individual Differences**  
    - **Personality Traits**: For example, introverts are naturally more sensitive to external stimuli and may feel more pressure in unfamiliar settings, while those high in "novelty-seeking" may enjoy exploring the unknown.  
    - **Past Experiences**: Negative experiences in unfamiliar environments can reinforce anxiety about such situations.  
----------  

Avoiding unfamiliar environments and reducing interactions with unfamiliar people is not a solution—unless we can return to our comfort zones and never encounter unfamiliar people again.  

On the contrary, the only way to eliminate this unease is to bravely confront this instinctive fear, turning the unfamiliar into the familiar and the strange into the known. At the same time, maintaining confidence, not fearing negative judgment or uncertainty, and rediscovering self-efficacy through personal interests can help us regain self-affirmation.

In this process, we will rewrite our "social scripts," enabling us to achieve greater accomplishments and reshape our inherent perceptions.
