Tomorrow, I have an exam in Guiyang for a public institution under the Department of Transportation, so today I’m rushing to catch a bus to Guiyang.  

As I left the house, I overheard two kids talking. One of them said:  

> When I was little, I thought if a mouse got sick, it should take rat poison.  

Exams are truly expensive, especially since hotels turn into a seller’s market whenever there’s an exam—price hikes are inevitable. Many hotels have raised their rates so much that they practically deserve to be publicly shamed on utility poles.  

It’s tough for examinees too. Most of them don’t have stable jobs to begin with. The exams themselves are already hard enough, and on top of that, they have to endure being bled dry by these price-gougers.

Spending money but still not getting a decent place to stay is really frustrating.
