A few days ago, I stayed up late and suddenly sneezed loudly in the middle of the night. The next morning, I woke up feeling sick, with a sore throat. It has been uncomfortable until today, with my throat painfully dry every morning, coughing up phlegm with traces of blood.

Today, we laid my grandmother to rest on the mountain, buried together with my grandfather. Huanhuan also came. It's fortunate that I took Huanhuan to see my grandmother while she was still alive. Looking back, it was an incredibly right decision, even though her parents didn't quite understand and were somewhat reluctant at the time. We cannot get to know and understand a person through a black coffin; the charm of life exists only when there is life.

I haven't written in my diary for the past few days and have been too lazy to recall and fill in the gaps. Perhaps it's because I've been sick; I've been exceptionally tired lately, with dizzy eyes and a dizzy head.

Regarding my recent situation, it might make one feel helpless and lost. Work, studies, life, family, love, time, ideals—nothing seems to be going well, which is overwhelming. I think we are not afraid of making choices, even if they are wrong; as long as we move forward firmly, even if we change direction and continue moving forward. Except for death, there is no end in life.

I remember comparing our lives to the process of food digestion. Whether we are apples, rice, eggs, beef, water, or something else, our birth is like entering the mouth of society. We are broken down and absorbed, and we see the value we contain. When we no longer have value, we are expelled from this society.

It seems that our life ends just like that. What can we choose in this process? Thinking carefully, there are quite a few options. Starting from entering the mouth, we can choose to stick to the front teeth of society; we can also become a fishbone stuck in the gums of society; entering the stomach, feeling unbearable, we can turn into watermelon or scalding hot pot oil to quickly end this painful process; we can even adopt the sacrificial flow strategy, turning into sweet drinks, giving our all to offer ourselves, causing society to develop diseases like diabetes...

Of course, these are just our fantasies. Often, we can't even decide what we are. It's even possible that society doesn't want to consume us, and most foods will inevitably have their nutrients absorbed and be expelled. However, the good thing is that what consumes us has its own life; it also gets sick and dies, then decomposes and is absorbed. After we are expelled, although the nutrients are gone—nutrients that are for the society that digests us—we, having left this society, actually return to or enter a broader world, continuing the cycle of life.

If the truth of life is indeed like this, how should we choose our path? Different people will give different answers, some of which may work temporarily. Turning ourselves into various toxic substances, from the perspective of the ecosystem we are in, often has little effect. 

Perhaps the most positive and optimistic attitude is to view this process of digestion as a journey. Actively explore and observe, to see the exquisite world our life has created and nurtured; it's also fine to quietly complete this journey without any thought.
