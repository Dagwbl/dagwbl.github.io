## Is Our Earth Real?

Yesterday, I came home for the holiday and went to bed early. In the morning, Manman ran to my bedside to play with my phone, but soon got bored. After glancing through the app list, I opened Google Earth and asked Manman where she wanted to go.

Man: I know this is Earth, our planet! It’s so, so big!  

Me: Yes, Earth is very big, but it’s also very small. Look at those stars next to it—they seem tiny, but many of them are likely bigger than Earth.  

Man: Where are we?  

Me: First, we need to find Asia, then our country—China. After that, we’re in Guizhou Province, right? Then Liupanshui…  

Man: Uncle’s house!  

Me: Right! That’s Shuicheng. We’re in Pan County.  

Man: Where’s Pan County?  

Me: We’re in Pan County right now. Hongguo, the center of Pan County—you went there with Mom just the day before yesterday.  

…  

Finally, we zoomed out to see how big Earth is, and Manman discovered that the globe could be rotated. She said she wanted to spin it.  

Me: Earth actually rotates on its own.  

Man: Then why isn’t it spinning (the Earth on the phone)?  

Me: This Earth is fake (the one on the phone).  

Man: Then is our Earth fake too?  

Me: It’s probably real… but it could also be fake. But the one on the phone is definitely fake.  

Manman’s sudden suspicion about Earth struck me like lightning, instantly wiping away all my drowsiness. I quickly followed up with another question.  

Me: Are you real?  

Man: I can’t tell you. You’ll have to guess.  

With that, Manman walked out the door.
