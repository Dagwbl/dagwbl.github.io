I'm really feeling a bit homesick. Huanhuan and I got up early to catch the bus home, and Auntie cooked us some delicious congee.

We bought a big rolled rice pancake at Sige, and as soon as we got home, we started eating again. These past few days have been nonstop eating.

My parents planned to sell the corn to avoid it getting infested with bugs or mold from sitting around unused. They decided to sell it to my fourth aunt’s family for 1.2 yuan per jin. Before long, they arrived.

There was quite a lot of corn. We started moving it around at noon and didn’t finish loading it onto the truck until the afternoon. The total came to 3,858 jin, which should have been over 4,600 yuan. I suggested 4,500, but my mom said 4,000 would be fine.

The weather was really nice today, and the clouds looked so clean.
