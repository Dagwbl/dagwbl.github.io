### 23:48 Shoulders Feel So Sore  

Another day has come to an end, and I can barely recall what I did today.  

Let me think: studying, helping Mom with her phone, playing on my phone, sleeping.  

### 23:49 Created a New Templater Template for Callouts  

I often use callouts in my notes for exercises, notes, tips, and the like. Writing them in native syntax gets tedious, especially with all the switching between Chinese and English. So, I made a Templater template to make it easier.  

```markdown
> [!<% tp.system.suggester((item) => item, ["question", "note", "tip"]) %>]+ <% tp.system.prompt("Please input callout title", "Example") %>  
> <% tp.system.clipboard() %>  
>  
```  

For the main content, I used Metan AI to transcribe it, which made things much more convenient.  

### 23:53 Added an `stime` Attribute to My Journal  

This attribute tracks daily phone usage time to analyze long-term changes in my habits.  

I originally wanted to log sleep time too, but I sometimes nap at noon, and phone tracking isn’t accurate enough. So, I’ll leave it at that for now.
