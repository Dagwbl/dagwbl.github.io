The news of my successful interview with the Emergency Management Bureau has already reached my teachers. This morning, both Teacher Hu and Teacher Dai messaged me to ask about it. Teacher Hu even joked that if the CSC (China Scholarship Council) doesn’t come through, he’d feel terribly guilty—hahaha. Of course, I don’t see it that way at all, and I reassured him with sincere gratitude.

After washing the dishes and taking a shower, the entire morning slipped by.  

Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival, and Huanhuan mentioned she’s going to her grandmother’s house to celebrate, and I’ll be joining her.  

At noon, I noticed something seemed off about Huanhuan. Around 2 p.m., she called and shared a lot about her recent emotional journey. I think it’s great that she’s brave enough to acknowledge some of the less positive thoughts in her mind. She had been struggling alone for a long time, hadn’t even eaten lunch, and even lied to me, saying the cafeteria was too crowded at noon.  

After hanging up, I ordered her some Dicos (a fast-food chain), and I also started packing my things to head to Hongguo to meet her.
