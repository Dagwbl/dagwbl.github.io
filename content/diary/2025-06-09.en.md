Last night, I stayed up until 1:30 AM playing games—completely immersed and forgetting to eat or sleep. Twin Shadow Wonderland was just too much fun.

This morning, we played for another hour and finally managed to finish the entire game.

Huanhuan had to leave for Guiyang today to report for training, so after packing lightly, it was time to go. We wanted to eat bean rice hotpot, but the place wasn’t open, so we took a ride to Lucky Dog for burgers and hot dogs, which weren’t very good.

We still had some time before the train, so we sat outside chatting about the present and the future—everything seems to be going well.

After coming back, I felt completely drained from staying up late, groggy and sluggish all day.
