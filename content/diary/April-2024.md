## Apr 1

Unconsciously, it's already April. I **feel** that my progress cannot **keep up with** the **pace of aging.**

I want to change my life **now** and explore the possibility of life. **But this** behavior **has put a lot of** pressure on me.

There is one of the most important factors **that hinders** me to learn English **continuously**. It's **the** cell phone. I **have** to learn how to resist this big monster. Cutting its tongue is a very useful method, I thought.
