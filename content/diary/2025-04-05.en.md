Since Huanhuan's family was heading back to their hometown in Yingwu, we got up very early today. By eight o'clock, we had finished breakfast, packed up, and set off. Dad also came with us, as we were giving him a ride to the coal mine where he works along the way.

The road conditions were quite good, and there was no traffic congestion at all. Today's driving was steadier than yesterday's, but because I hadn’t slept well, my eyes were very uncomfortable, and I felt exhausted the whole time.

I don’t quite agree with Uncle Luo’s viewpoint—he tends to label people, believing that officials can’t and shouldn’t do manual labor, while he himself should just keep working hard without complaint. People are multifaceted, and being an official is just a profession.

By evening, I was so tired that I fell asleep without even taking off my clothes or washing up.

It's just 3 a.m. again, and I woke up, then couldn't fall back asleep. It's really uncomfortable—I might be sick.
