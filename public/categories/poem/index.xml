      <description>Stray birds of summer come to my window sing and fly away. And the leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh.
O troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my words.
The worlds puts off its mask of vastness to its lover. It becomes small, as one song, as one kiss of the eternal.
It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom.</description>
